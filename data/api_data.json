Introduction 2. Short title 3. Effective Date 4. Applicability 5. Definitions 6. Principles for authentication of digital payment transactions 7. Interoperability / Open Access 8. Risk based approach 9. Responsibility of the issuer 10. Cross-border transactions 11. Repeal Annexure-1 Annexure-2 1. Introduction All digital payment transactions in India are required to meet the norm of two factors of authentication. While no specific factor was mandated for authentication, the digital payments ecosystem has primarily adopted SMS-based One Time Password (OTP) as the additional factor. As announced in Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated February 08, 2024 , in order to enable the payments ecosystem to leverage the technological advancements for implementing alternative authentication mechanisms, it has been decided to publish Reserve Bank of India (Authentication mechanisms for digital payment transactions) Directions, 2025 (hereinafter referred to as “Directions”) . The directions provide the broad principles which shall be complied with by all the participants in the payment chain, while using a form of authentication. While these directions are applicable only to domestic transactions, in order to provide a similar level of safety for online international transactions undertaken using cards issued in India, the directions also incorporate necessary instructions for specific cross-border card transactions, in line with the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated February 07, 2025 . These directions are issued under Section 18 read with Section 10(2) of the Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007). 2. Short title These directions shall be called Reserve Bank of India (Authentication mechanisms for digital payment transactions) Directions, 2025 3. Effective Date All Payment System Providers and Payment System Participants, including banks and non-bank entities, shall ensure compliance with these directions by April 01, 2026, unless indicated otherwise for any specific provision herein. 4. Applicability These directions shall be applicable to all Payment System Providers and Payment System Participants (banks and non-banks). These directions apply to all domestic digital payment transactions, unless specifically exempted otherwise. 5. Definitions I. Unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall bear the meanings assigned to them as below: Authentication : Process of validating and confirming the credentials of the customer who is originating the payment instruction. Card Not Present (CNP) transaction : A transaction where the card and acceptance infrastructure are not present in close proximity while making the transaction. Card Present transaction : A transaction that is carried out through the physical use of card at the point of transaction. Cross-border CNP transaction : A payment instruction wherein the card, issued by an Indian issuer, is used for undertaking a payment transaction favouring a merchant acquired by an overseas acquirer. For such transactions, outflow of foreign exchange is envisaged. Digital Payment Transaction shall have the same meaning as “Electronic Funds Transfer” as defined in the PSS Act, 2007. Factor of Authentication : Credential of the customer which is used for authentication. The factors of authentication can be from “something the user has”, “something the user knows” or “something the user is” and may comprise, inter-alia, password, SMS based OTP, passphrase, PIN, card hardware, software token, fingerprint, or any other form of biometrics (device native or Aadhaar based). Issuer : A bank or a non-bank that maintains the customer’s account from which payment is made, such as a deposit account or a credit line or a prepaid instrument. II. Words and expressions used but not defined in these directions and defined in the PSS Act, 2007 shall have the meanings assigned to them in that Act. 6. Principles for authentication of digital payment transactions The technology and process deployed for authenticating a payment instruction by the Payment System Provider / Payment System Participant(s) shall comply with the following principles: a. Minimum two factors of authentication All digital payment transactions shall be authenticated by at least two distinct factors of authentication as defined in paragraph-5(f), unless exempted. The list of exemptions which are currently in force are listed in Annexure-1 . Note - Issuers may, at their discretion, offer a choice of authentication factors to their customers in compliance with these directions. b. At least one of the factors to be dynamic It shall be ensured that for digital payment transactions, other than card present transactions, at least one of the factors of authentication is dynamically created or proven, i.e., the proof of possession of the factor, being sent as part of the transaction, is unique to that transaction. c. Robust The factor of authentication shall be such that compromise of one factor does not affect reliability of the other. 7. Interoperability / Open Access System Providers and System Participants shall offer authentication or tokenisation service that is accessible to all the applications / token requestors functioning in that operating environment for all use cases / channels or token storage mechanisms. Note – Operating environment includes device hardware, operating system, etc. The terms, ‘tokenisation’, ‘token requestor’, ‘use cases/channels’ and ‘token storage mechanisms’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them in the RBI directions on “Tokenisation – Card Transactions” dated January 08, 2019 , as amended from time to time. 8. Risk based approach Issuers may, in line with their internal risk management policies, identify transactions for evaluation against behavioural / contextual parameters such as transaction location, user behaviour patterns, device attributes, historical transaction profile, etc. Based on the perceived risk associated with the transaction, additional checks beyond the minimum two-factor authentication may be resorted to. Issuers may also explore using DigiLocker as a platform for notification and confirmation for high-risk transactions. 9. Responsibility of the issuer An issuer shall ensure the robustness and integrity of the authentication mechanism before deployment. If any loss arises out of transactions effected without complying with these directions, the issuer shall compensate the customer for the loss in full without demur. Issuers shall ensure adherence to the provisions of Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. 10. Cross-border transactions The directions outlined above are not applicable to cross-border digital payment transactions. However, card issuers shall, by October 01, 2026, put in place a mechanism to validate non-recurring, cross-border card not present (CNP) transactions, where request for authentication is raised by an overseas merchant or overseas acquirer. To ensure compliance, card issuers shall register their Bank Identification Numbers (BINs) with card networks. Further, a risk-based mechanism for handling all cross-border CNP transactions shall also be put in place by card issuers by October 01, 2026. 11. Repeal The list of circulars / directions that are repealed are listed in Annexure-2 . Annexure-1 (Reference: CO.DPSS.POLC.No. S 668/02-14-015/2025-2026 dated September 25, 2025) Existing exemptions from the requirement of at least two factors of authentication under paragraph-6(a) of these directions.

This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the RBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the bank's reply to the notice, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and additional submissions made by it, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: The bank had failed to: carry out periodic review of risk categorisation of certain accounts, with such periodicity being at least once in six months; and implement certain cyber security control measures under the Cyber Security Framework prescribed by RBI. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank.

Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the bank’s reply to the notice and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the bank was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: The bank had sold insurance products to its customers without adequate disclosure and transparency. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank.

      "summary": "Distinguished guests, participants, ladies and gentlemen, a very good evening. I am delighted to address this august gathering of distinguished persons, and key stakeholders across the financial spectrum in the banking transformation summit on the theme of ‘Banking That Builds Bharat: AI-Powered, Credit-Driven’, which is extremely contextual and relevant and encapsulates the spirit of Viksit Bharat . Introduction 2. The Indian banking system has time and again exhibited its capability to embrace and adapt to newer technologies. Beginning from the early days of computerization in the 1980s, to spread of ATMs in the 1990s, the expansion of internet and mobile banking in the 2000s, interoperable infrastructure for payments, data repositories and data sharing since 2010s, the banking sector has adapted successfully to the requirements of the changing times and has over the period made banking more efficient and inclusive. Banking has now entered into a new phase of evolution driven by digital democratization. A prime example is the homegrown Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which has made India a global leader in digital payments which reinforces our belief that responsible innovation can be a powerful driver of progress. 3. The Government of India has articulated an ambitious vision of “Viksit Bharat” i.e., transforming India into a developed country by 2047. This sets the tone for the next step in our technological journey of financial sector and more specifically, in the banking sector. Under Viksit Bharat, the goal is for every adult to not only have a bank account, a target largely achieved under Jan Dhan Yojana 2 , but also have access to affordable credit, insurance, and investment options. The endeavour of banking sector should be to ensure that benefits of banking, more so of credit accessibility, is made available to customers across all segments on a fair, transparent and affordable basis. Measures taken by RBI 4. In last five years, between 2019-20 to 2024-25, the bank credit growth has been averaging around 10.5 percent 3 . It is also seen that the share of retail credit has grown to 33 per cent 4 while the share of credit to Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector has been growing steadily, forming 18 per cent of total bank credit as of March 2025. Before delving into the role of new technologies, let me briefly first touch upon the steps taken by RBI over the years to increase flow of credit. 5. The RBI has undertaken several measures to expand both the reach and depth of credit by reducing friction, increasing access points, and lowering the cost of financial service delivery. Key initiatives include Aadhaar-based KYC, the Central KYC Registry, the revised Priority Sector Lending norms, Partial Credit Enhancement Guidelines, and the Account Aggregator framework 5 . In response to the growing digitalisation of credit, the Digital Lending Guidelines 6 were introduced to ensure transparency, fairness, data privacy, while enabling fund flow to wider sectors. The RBI has also enabled formal credit access through frameworks like Trade Receivables e-Discounting System (TReDS) for MSMEs, co-lending models between banks and NBFCs, and targeted refinancing schemes. 6. More recently, the RBI has, in collaboration with its subsidiary RBI Innovation Hub (RBIH), tested a prototype of the Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit 7 to enable seamless digital data flow to lenders. Building on this, the Unified Lending Interface (ULI) 8 is being developed to transform credit delivery by integrating access to both financial and non-financial data such as digitised land records, Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) data, property records, and satellite data along with services like e-KYC, the Account Aggregator framework, and Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE). This ecosystem aims to make lending faster, cheaper, and more accessible to underserved segments. Together, this digital public infrastructure and an enabling regulatory framework would help to drive inclusive credit growth. Gaps in access to formal credit 7. Having said that, a lot of distance still needs to be traversed, as the gap in credit penetration persists. Even today, only around 25 per cent of India’s adult population have formal access to institutional credit 9 while in the MSME sector (which forms ~30 per cent of GDP) 10 , only part of their credit needs is met by formal institutions 11 . While the Financial Inclusion Index developed by RBI has shown steady improvement, rising from 53.9 in March 2021 to 67.0 in March 2025 12 reflecting the growth in account ownership and credit access, scope remains in effecting improvement in the usage and quality of services delivered. The gap between inclusion and credit access is a challenge and an opportunity to banking fraternity. The credit needs to not only grow in terms of volume and numbers but also needs to be directed towards productive, sectors that deliver higher multipliers such as MSMEs, infrastructure, informal sectors, and rural population, to achieve not just the goal of “ Viksit Bharat ” but to have a “ Samaveshi Viksit Bharat” . The new wave in banking- Artificial Intelligence 8. Driving the next credit revolution will require harnessing new technologies. Over time, the role of technology in finance has shifted from improving operational efficiency to fully automating and centralizing previously manual, fragmented processes. Among emerging technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands out for its vast potential from strengthening internal operations and risk management to delivering faster, more seamless customer experiences. Reports indicate that nearly 70% of Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) organisations in India have an enterprise level AI strategy in FY 2024 13 . An RBI study of banks’ annual reports also shows a sharp rise in references to AI, underscoring its growing strategic importance 14 . While both demand-side factors (profitability, competition, compliance efficiency) and supply-side drivers (tech advances, data growth, new business models) influence AI adoption, supply-side forces remain the primary catalyst. 9. AI as a discipline has evolved over decades and has seen rise of machine learning systems which can learn from historical data to make decisions, often with high accuracy. Indian banks and non-banks, embarked on AI journey nearly a decade ago, mainly handling at that time, large volume of information and supplementary analysis which added value without displacing established systems. The adoption has since moved from deployment of AI for back-office functions for efficiency enhancements to more varied use cases such as in the areas of fraud risk management, optimising IT operations, facial recognition for KYC, credit scoring, claim processing, and customer focused services. As observed in the surveys conducted by RBI in 2023 and 2024 15 , more than three-fourth of the banks have deployed AI-powered chatbots for customer service. This marks a fundamental shift in which AI is no longer just an enabler but a part of the decision-making process, product design, and customer engagement. AI across the credit lifecycle 10. Though, the banks have been using AI in some areas of lending, there is potential use cases for its usage across other areas of the credit lifecycle. I would like to highlight a few of them: (i) Credit Inclusion 11. An important use case would be in the way credit is assessed and distributed. This would require supplementing existing assessment methods with broader data based and more refined analysis, whereby financial institutions could gain additional perspectives on risk and capability of the potential borrowers. This would be a significant game changer to address the credit requirement of the millions of “credit invisibles”, i.e., people with no formal credit history or new to credit customers. Given the availability of a variety of digital footprints which customers have, AI can be leveraged to peruse alternative data sets, to assess their creditworthiness. This would mean a paradigm shift from asset-based lending to cash-flow and alternate data-based lending, promoting a journey towards inclusive digital finance. Government of India also has recognised the potential of alternate data to drive financial inclusion and has started initiatives such as the “Grameen Credit Score” 16 which aims to provide underserved communities with formal credit access by analyzing alternative financial data, including UPI transactions, government subsidy receipts, and utility payments. (ii) Turnaround Time 12. AI enables banks to process large volumes of customer data quickly, accelerating credit decisions and service delivery. This is especially valuable in time-sensitive sectors like MSME working capital, where AI can analyse diverse datasets like bank statements, payment histories, GST filings, e-invoices, TReDS receivables, and public records. It also aids lenders in assessing seasonality, supply chains, inventory cycles, customer concentration, and overall creditworthiness of MSMEs. (iii) Credit Appraisals 13. The banks can embrace AI algorithms for leveraging behavioural analytics by analysing vast amounts of transactional data for detecting patterns indicative of creditworthiness and stable financial behaviour, leading to more accurate credit assessments and improved decision-making processes. (iv) Customized Credit Solutions 14. AI’s ability to dynamically assess customer preferences and behaviour can empower banks to offer customized credit solutions tailored to an individual’s financial capacity. This not only improves loan accessibility but also ensures that borrowers receive fair and structured financial products that align with their needs. (v) Early Warning Signals and Provisioning 15. AI-based early warning systems can help lenders monitor credit portfolios more effectively through dynamic risk scoring and real-time default probability tracking. By flagging early signs of financial stress, these systems protect the lender’s balance sheet while giving borrowers a chance to course-correct. The goal, ultimately, is not just to lend more but to lend better. (vi) Document Management 16. AI also plays a key role in automating document verification by using techniques like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read and process information from documents – especially handwritten documents which are generally unstructured, allowing for automated extraction of data thus reducing rejections. It can also examine the visual characteristics of the documents to detect forgery, tampering, or modifications and accurately process large volumes of records, classifying, extracting, and validating key data, thereby improving efficiency and minimizing errors in the lending process. (vii) Customer Support and Grievance Redress 17. One promising use case of AI is the development of multilingual chatbots and voice assistants which enable customers to interact with banks in their native language. This is a revolutionary change as by localizing the user experience, the AI can enable more people across different languages, literacy levels, and abilities to confidently use formal banking services. 18. Banks are also experimenting with using AI powered virtual assistants to enable staff to respond to customer queries which can enhance customer experience. Timely resolution of customer queries boosts trust in the banking system and encourages deeper engagement, furthering financial inclusion. As digital access has expanded, so has customer complaints. This highlights another use case for AI. It can efficiently categorize, prioritize, and route complaints, enabling faster, proactive resolution by detecting patterns and addressing root causes before issues escalate into grievances. (viii) Loan Servicing 19. AI-powered loan servicing platforms can create personalised repayment solutions and reduce operational errors across servicing and portfolio management. They can also provide new ways of loan servicing by supporting collections and recovery through prioritised outreach strategies. AI can help to strengthen compliance with auditable trails of measures initiated for recovery. (ix) Fraud Risk Management and Cyber Security 20. AI also holds potential in safeguarding the financial system itself. As cybercriminals increasingly use AI for sophisticated attacks, Regulated Entities (REs) can leverage AI-driven tools to protect customers and detect threats. AI can monitor large transaction volumes in real time, flagging anomalies that may assist in detecting fraud or money laundering. Collaboration for Credit Revolution 21. With fintechs advancing rapidly, REs are increasingly partnering with them across the credit lifecycle. A key model—Digital Lending, involves embedding processes like KYC, credit assessment, and collection directly into fintech platforms. While such collaborations enhance financial inclusion and innovation, they also bring risks such as blurred accountability, data misuse, inadequate grievance redressal, and potential mis-selling. The guiding principle to address this remains the premise that regardless of the model used, accountability ultimately rests with the regulated entity. Risks and challenges of AI - New dimensions and the Ethical imperative 22. Technological advancements come with challenges that REs must recognize, as these risks can undermine the benefits of innovation. For example, the recent Supreme Court ruling 17 on video-based e-KYC highlighted that mandatory automated processes may create barriers for people with disabilities, underscoring the need for fairness and accessibility in technology adoption to avoid exclusions. AI, without proper controls, can introduce risks like algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, ethical concerns, and systemic vulnerabilities. It can also amplify existing risks such as third-party dependencies, concentration, model, cyber, and data privacy risks. Let me highlight a few: (i) Third-party dependency 23. As AI adoption grows, financial institutions increasingly rely on complex networks of external providers, cloud platforms, AI vendors, and data aggregators. These interdependencies create vulnerabilities where a disruption or breach in one link can cascade across multiple institutions, disrupting critical services. The complexity and opacity of these layers makes it difficult to identify risks, which may accumulate unnoticed and spread rapidly during shocks. (ii) Market Correlation 24. A critical vulnerability of AI is its potential to synchronize behaviors across the financial system. When institutions use similar models trained on overlapping data, their decisions on asset pricing, credit assessment, trading, and others may align, creating hidden linkages. This can amplify market stress, spread shocks rapidly, worsen liquidity shortages, increase asset price volatility, and trigger sharp, self-reinforcing market swings. (iii) Cyber Risk 25. The integration of AI into financial systems—especially through new interaction methods and increased reliance on specialized providers expands the cyber threat landscape in unpredictable ways. AI’s strengths, such as reliance on large datasets, open interfaces, and automated decisions, also create vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can exploit these through adversarial attacks or compromised training data, potentially corrupting AI outputs. Even a single breach can disrupt critical operations across multiple REs and undermine trust in AI across the sector. (iv) Model Risk 26. Unlike traditional models built on clear rules and well laid out assumptions, AI models operate through dense, opaque algorithms, which we also refer to as “black boxes” and evolve with the data they consume. This introduces the risk of prejudice within models where biased data, opaque design, or untested assumptions may lead to biased outcomes of model. Such distortions can lead to unfair credit assessment, excluding deserving segments, or conversely extending credit where risks are understated. (v) Data Risk 27. AI is only as strong as the data that shapes it and this leads to a host of vulnerabilities emanating from data quality. Currently, while most of the financial data is structured, much of it is fragmented across systems, often in inconsistent formats, sometimes incomplete or outdated, or skewed by historical biases. When such data flows into AI models, it can produce results that may appear authentic, but suboptimal and in some cases may produce wrong outputs. Over-reliance on such models can quietly turn data gaps into large-scale misjudgments and wrong business decisions. (vi) Legal Certainty and Intellectual Property Right issues 28. AI models are often trained on publicly available data, like news stories, articles, and explainer videos, etc., and may lead to intellectual property and copyright infringements. (vii) Concentration Risk 29. Reserve Bank’s Financial Stability Report 18 has pointed out the high market concentration in critical third-party providers of cloud/ AI services, noting that heavy reliance on a small number of tech players could create single points of failure. Such concentration risks are compounded by the vertical integration of certain providers, who supply not just models but also the underlying infrastructure and datasets. (viii) Frauds and disinformation 30. While AI is transforming many of the processes of financial institutions, the rise of Generative AI has also lowered the barriers for fraud, putting powerful deception tools in the hands of malicious actors. Deepfakes can mimic voices, faces, and documents with unsettling accuracy, while AI-generated phishing lures, fake identities, and forged credentials can slip past traditional checks. 31. In light of these multi-faceted risks, some of which I have touched upon, it becomes crucial that adoption of AI in banking sector must be done in a responsible and measured manner. The excitement around AI’s benefits should not overshadow prudent risk management. In this context, the following aspects become even more crucial. (i) Governance 32. A robust governance is indispensable for ensuring the integrity of data, the reliability of models, and mitigating the risks associated with adoption of AI. The financial institutions should have in place a comprehensive strategy for AI adoption. It should be accompanied by clear policies, risk appetites, criticality, and impact assessments as well as ethical standards that cascade through the organisation. Robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms should be put in place to ensure alignment between innovation goals and institutional stability. Further, in a regulated industry like banking, it is essential to understand how a model arrives at its decisions, making explainability a critical requirement. Thus, there is a need for financial institutions to invest in Explainable AI frameworks that provide clear, auditable reasons for loan decisions. Strong governance is central to managing AI-driven model risk. (ii) Human-in-the-loop 33. While AI can automate and recommend, the humans should be responsible for the decisions. The financial institutions while adopting AI for business processes should implement the principle of human-in the-loop to ensure that AI is leveraged as a tool to support and enhance human decisions and not replace them. (iii) Maintaining Data quality and security 34. High-quality data is the backbone of safe and effective AI in finance. While the RBI already collects data through supervisory reports, regulatory returns, and surveys, the introduction of model risk guidelines, aligned with global best practices, will soon extend this scope to include data on AI models used by regulated entities. Financial institutions should therefore adopt robust data strategies, incorporating diverse, reliable indicators that reflect both the scale of AI adoption and associated vulnerabilities. 35. When AI is used for credit decisioning or financial inclusion, especially through alternative data, customer data becomes central, making privacy and security paramount. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 provides the legal framework for responsible data use, and financial institutions must ensure compliance through consent-based, privacy-first data handling practices. (iv) Research and Development 36. Continued investment in research and development is critical for advancing the capabilities of AI in lending lifecycle for unlocking new opportunities. Research efforts of the financial institutions should focus on improving data quality and accessibility, developing novel AI algorithms for enhancing credit inclusion, and addressing key challenges related to bias, fairness, and interpretability in credit evaluation as well as enhancement of in-house capabilities to manage concentration risk of providers. (v) Industry Collaborations 37. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing among industry stakeholders, including financial institutions, fintech companies, and academic institutions is essential for driving innovation and addressing common challenges in AI-driven credit processes. This can foster the development of best practices, standards, and frameworks for responsible AI use, promoting transparency, fairness, and accountability in credit evaluation. Some of the initial areas where the industry can collaboratively work is harmonising AI taxonomies and developing common benchmarks and metrics. Regulatory guardrails for new technologies 38. As AI adoption gains traction, regulatory oversight is crucial in ensuring an efficient, responsible and fair adoption. Recognising the increasing usage of model-driven credit assessments and decision-making in REs, the RBI had issued a draft circular on model risk management in credit 19 , setting out expectations on governance, validation, monitoring, and accountability. Building on this foundation and recognising the increasing usage of models by the REs, not only for credit functions but also for wide spectrum of processes across functional and operational domains, the Bank is in the process of expanding the scope of these guidelines and would be issuing overarching Model Risk Management Guidelines applicable across all models. As technologies like AI are generally not adopted uniformly across the sector and owing to presence of a varied type of entities with different scales, the principle of proportionality has to be also factored in. The objective would be to ensure that all REs can adopt technologies best suited to their business models and customer needs, while effectively managing risks such as explainability, algorithmic bias, resilience, and over-automation 20 . In continuation of this approach, the recently released report of the Committee on Framework for Responsible, Efficient, and Ethical AI (FREE-AI) 21 , has laid out seven guiding sutras for trustworthy AI, and emphasized the need for a robust model risk management framework by REs. Conclusion 39. Over the decades, Indian banking sector has exhibited its ability to integrate meaningful technological advancements. As AI transforms financial services, it's clear this is a development which is not a mere upgrade but a major shift impacting products, processes, and operations. From the risk perspective, the long-term implications of AI adoption on the financial system remain uncertain but exhibit potentially far-reaching consequences. It is therefore imperative for the financial sector to approach AI adoption with foresight, investing not just in innovation, but also in resilience by building strong governance structure, diversifying dependencies, engaging in continual assessment of emerging risks, and ensuring their AI strategies align with long-term safety and sustainability of the financial system. Ensuring that AI-driven decisions are ethical, unbiased, and transparent will be paramount in building a sustainable, AI-powered financial future. This calls for “ optimistic vigilance ” wherein AI and other technologies in banking are neither feared nor embraced blindly but “ navigated” . The RBI, on its part, will continue to provide an enabling regulatory environment so that together we can build a banking system that truly builds Bharat, and not just builds, but transforms Bharat. 40. Let me sign off with the thought “Trust is the currency of banking”. Even as we broaden the credit coverage using algorithms and digital interfaces, maintaining the trust will be our biggest challenge and also our biggest responsibility.

It has been decided to transition CTS to continuous clearing and settlement on realisation in two phases. Phase 1 shall be implemented on October 4, 2025 and Phase 2 on January 3, 2026. The modalities for the same are given in Annex . 3. All banks are advised to make their customers adequately aware of the changes in the cheque clearing process. 4. Banks are also advised to be in readiness to participate in continuous clearing in CTS on the above dates. 5. This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007). Yours faithfully, (Saurabh Nath) Chief General Manager Annex Modalities for Continuous Clearing with Settlement On-realisation in CTS 1. Single presentation session with continuous delivery: There shall be a single presentation session from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Cheques received by the branches shall be scanned and sent to the clearing house by the banks immediately and continuously during the presentation session. The clearing house will in turn release the cheque images to drawee banks on a continuous basis. 2. Continuous inward processing and confirmation by banks: The confirmation session shall start at 10:00 AM and close at 7:00 PM. For every cheque presented, the drawee bank shall generate either positive confirmation (for honoured cheques) or negative confirmation (for dishonoured cheques). Each cheque will contain the ‘Item Expiry Time’ which indicates the latest time by which confirmation for the presented instrument needs to be provided by the drawee bank. Processing by drawee banks is to be done continuously throughout the day and on a real time basis as soon as cheque images are received. Information of positive/negative confirmation shall be sent by the drawee banks to the clearing house immediately after processing. 3. Time available for inward processing: During phase 1 (From October 4 to January 2, 2026), drawee banks shall be required to confirm (positively / negatively) cheques presented on them latest by end of confirmation session (i.e. 7:00 PM) else those will be deemed to have been approved and included for settlement. Item expiry time for all cheques shall be set as 7:00 PM in phase 1. In Phase 2 (from January 3, 2026), the item expiry time of cheques shall be changed to T+3 clear hours. For example, the cheques received by drawee banks between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM will have to be confirmed positively or negatively by them by 2:00 PM (3 hours from 11:00 AM). Cheques for which confirmation is not provided by the drawee bank in the prescribed 3 hours shall be treated as deemed approved and included for settlement at 2:00 PM. 4. Settlement on realisation: No accounting entries (settlement) will be posted for presentation of cheques. Starting from 11:00 AM, settlement will be arrived every hour till the end of confirmation session, based on the positive confirmations received from drawee banks and cheques considered deemed approved. No accounting entries shall be passed for cheques with negative confirmation. 5. Releasing payment to customers: On completion of settlement, clearing house shall release the information of positive and negative confirmations to the presenting bank. The presenting bank shall process the same and release the payment to the customers immediately, but not later than 1 hour from successful settlement, subject to usual safeguards.",

Introduction 1. Non-fund based (NFB) facilities like guarantees, letters of credit, co-acceptances etc. facilitate effective credit intermediation and smooth business transactions. In order to harmonize and consolidate guidelines covering these facilities across the entities regulated by the Reserve Bank and to broaden the funding sources for infrastructure financing, the Reserve Bank had issued draft guidelines on NFB facilities for public comments on April 9, 2025. The comments received thereon have been analysed and suitably incorporated in these Directions. 2. In exercise of the powers conferred under sections 21 and 35A read with section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, sections 45JA, 45L and 45M of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and sections 30A, 32 and 33 of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, the Reserve Bank of India, being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in the public interest and in the interest of banking policy to do so, hereby, issues the Reserve Bank of India (Non-Fund Based Credit Facilities) Directions, 2025 (hereinafter referred to as ‘Directions’ ). B. Applicability 3. These Directions shall apply to the following entities, hereinafter referred to as Regulated Entity (RE) and collectively as Regulated Entities (REs), as the context may require, for all their Non-Fund Based (NFB) exposures such as guarantee, letter of credit, co-acceptance etc., unless otherwise permitted under these Directions or any regulatory guidelines/ directions issued by the Reserve Bank. Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks and Local Area Banks); Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs)/ State Co-operative Banks (StCBs)/ Central Co-operative Banks (CCBs); All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs); Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) including Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) in Middle Layer and above, only for the issuance of Partial Credit Enhancement, as permitted under Chapter IV of these Directions. Provided that these Directions shall not apply to the derivative exposures of a RE, other than the general conditions as laid down under Chapter II of these Directions. 4. These Directions shall come into force from April 1, 2026, or from any earlier date as decided by a RE as per its internal policy (“effective date”). Extension of any new NFB facility and renewal of an existing NFB facility after the effective date, shall be governed in terms of these Directions. All existing NFB facilities extended/ renewed till the effective date shall be governed by the existing instructions as applicable to the respective REs. C. Definitions 5. For the purpose of these Directions, the following definitions shall apply: “Beneficiary” means the party in whose favour the NFB facility is issued by a RE. “Co-acceptance of bills” means an undertaking to make payment to the drawer of the bill (seller/ exporter) on due date if the buyer/ importer fails to make the payment on that date. “Guarantee” means a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in the contingent case of his non-performance or default, in terms of The Indian Contract Act, 1872. “Guarantor” refers to the party which issues the guarantee. “Obligor” refers to a party against whose obligations, financial or otherwise, a NFB facility has been issued. In the case of guarantees, the obligor may also be termed as ‘principal debtor’, as defined under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. “Secured portion of an NFB facility” is the portion of the facility covered by realisable value of tangible security/ collateral estimated on a realistic basis. Chapter II General Conditions 6. The credit policy of a RE shall incorporate suitable provisions for issue of NFB facilities, inter alia, covering aspects relating to type of NFB facilities, limits granted, credit appraisal, security requirement, fraud prevention, overall monitoring mechanism including post-sanction monitoring, delegation matrix, audit and internal controls, compliance to uniform standards issued by standard setting bodies and other safeguards. 7. A RE shall issue a NFB facility only on behalf of a customer having funded credit facility from the RE. Provided that this clause shall not be applicable in respect of: Derivative contracts entered into by RE with counterparty. Partial Credit enhancement facility, as permitted under clause 23 of these Directions. NFB facilities issued based on the counter guarantee of another RE, as permitted under clause 15 of these Directions. NFB facilities on behalf of an obligor who has not availed any fund based facility from any RE in India. NFB facilities extended by a RE against No Objection Certificate issued by the RE/ REs which has/ have provided fund based facility to the obligor. NFB facilities which are fully secured by eligible financial collateral. Explanation: The eligible financial collateral specified herein for all REs shall be as defined under paragraph 7.3.5 of Master Circular – Basel III Capital Regulations dated April 01, 2025 as updated from time to time 8. A RE shall not issue a NFB facility to any entity assuring redemption/ repayment of funds raised by any entity via deposits, issuance of bonds, or in any other form, unless specifically permitted under any regulatory guidelines/ directions issued by the Reserve Bank. 9. Once a NFB facility devolves and is converted into a fund based facility, then the prudential norms shall be as applicable to fund based facilities. Chapter – III Conditions applicable to Guarantees and Co-acceptances A. Guarantees 10. In general, a guarantee (or a counter-guarantee) issued by a RE (guarantor) shall be irrevocable (i.e., there shall be no clause in the contract that would allow the guarantor to unilaterally cancel the same), unconditional (i.e. there shall be no clause in the contract that could prevent the RE from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the original counterparty fails to meet its obligation), incontrovertible and shall contain a clear mechanism for honouring the same without demur as and when invoked. 11. A RE shall put in place suitable internal aggregate/ individual ceilings for issuance of guarantees in general and unsecured guarantees in particular. Provided that the total volume of guaranteed obligations of UCBs, RRBs, LABs, StCBs and CCBs outstanding at any time shall not exceed 5% of their total assets as per the previous financial year’s balance sheet. Further, unsecured guarantees of these REs shall be restricted to 1.25% of total assets. Any such RE in breach of the above stipulation as on the date of issue of these Directions shall meet the above threshold by April 01, 2027. 12. The provisions of the internal policy relating to guarantees shall, inter alia, address aspects related to invocation and settlement mechanism, claim period, tenor, fee/ commission/ applicable charges, timelines for release of security, renewal, fraud prevention measures etc. Usage of electronic-Guarantee 13. Wherever a RE issues an electronic Guarantee, it shall frame a standard operating procedure (SOP) aimed at minimization of manual intervention; meeting system integration requirements; ensuring technological compatibility between the RE’s interface and the electronic Guarantee platforms, audit and internal controls etc. The SOP shall, inter alia, consider the aspects mentioned in Annex 1 . Guarantee favouring another RE 14. A RE shall, in general, not provide a guarantee favouring another RE to enable it to provide any fund based credit facility to an obligor. Provided that this clause shall not be applicable in case of credit facilities extended against guarantees pertaining to trade related transactions. 15. However, a RE may provide a guarantee favouring another RE for a NFB facility extended by the latter. Such guarantee issued by a RE shall be treated as an exposure on the obligor on whose behalf the guarantee has been issued by it, for all purposes including for the calculation of capital adequacy. The exposure of the RE extending credit facility against a guarantee shall be treated as a claim/ exposure on the RE which is providing the counter guarantee. Timely Payment of Invoked Guarantee 16. A RE shall honour the guarantee issued by it as and when invoked in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee deed unless there is court order restraining the same. B. Co-acceptances 17. Only genuine trade bills shall be co-accepted, and it shall be ensured that the goods covered by bills co-accepted are actually received in the stock accounts of the borrowers. 18. Proper records of the bills co-accepted for each customer shall be maintained, so that the commitments for each customer and the total commitments at a branch can be readily ascertained, and these shall be part of internal audit. 19. A RE shall not co-accept bills drawn by another RE or where the buyer/ seller has received funding for the underlying trade transaction from any RE. C. Requirements for Other Specific Guarantees Guarantee and related business involving overseas current or capital account transaction 20. REs permitted as Authorized Dealer (AD) may extend NFB facilities as permitted under the extant regulations/ Directions issued under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, for bonafide current or capital account transaction, including guarantees in respect of debt or other liability incurred by an exporter on account of exports from India. 21. AD banks are also permitted to issue guarantee to or on behalf of a foreign entity, or any of its step-down subsidiary in which an Indian entity has acquired control through the foreign entity, which is backed by a counter-guarantee or collateral by the Indian entity or its group company. Provided that such guarantees shall not be issued by banks, including overseas branches/ subsidiaries of Indian banks, for the purpose of raising loans/ advances of any kind by the foreign entity except in connection with the ordinary course of business overseas. Further while extending such guarantees, banks shall ensure effective monitoring of the end use of such facilities and its conformity with the business needs of such entities. Guarantees on behalf of Stock/ Commodity Brokers 22. Only Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) may issue guarantees on behalf of stock/ commodity brokers in favour of stock/ commodity exchanges in lieu of security deposit to the extent it is acceptable in the form of bank guarantee as laid down by exchanges. SCBs may also issue guarantees in lieu of margin requirements as per exchange regulations read along with other instructions issued by Reserve Bank in this regard from time to time. Chapter - IV Partial Credit Enhancement 23. SCBs (excluding RRBs), AIFIs, NBFCs including HFCs in Middle Layer and above (together termed as “REs” for the purpose of Chapter IV) may provide Partial Credit Enhancement (PCE) to bonds issued by corporates/ special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for funding all types of projects and to bonds issued by Non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of ₹1,000 crore and above registered with RBI (including HFCs). PCE may also be provided to bonds issued by Municipal Corporations subject to adherence to, inter alia, paragraph 2.3.7.3 (iii) of Master Circular - Loans and Advances – Statutory and Other Restrictions dated July 01, 2015 as amended from time to time. 24. The objective behind allowing REs to extend PCE is to enhance the credit rating of the bonds issued so as to enable corporates to access the funds from the bond market on better terms. The guidelines in this regard are as below: A. Salient features of the PCE facility 25. The credit policy of the RE shall incorporate suitable provisions for issue of PCE, covering issues such as quantum of PCE, underwriting standards, assessment of risk, pricing, setting limits, etc. 26. PCE shall be a subordinated facility provided in the form of an irrevocable contingent line of credit which will be drawn in case of shortfall in cash flows for servicing the bonds and thereby may improve the credit rating of the bond issue. The contingent facility may, at the discretion of the PCE providing RE, be made available as a revolving facility. 27. A clear agreement documenting all aspects of this arrangement shall be signed between the promoter (bond issuer), the PCE providing RE, the bondholders (through the Trustee) and all other lenders to the project. The agreement to this effect shall be in the nature of a legally binding contract. The documentation for the facility shall clearly define the circumstances under which the facility would be drawn upon. 28. The PCE exposure limit by a single RE shall be 50 per cent of the bond issue size. The aggregate exposure limit of all REs towards the PCE for a given bond issue has also been capped at 50 per cent of the bond issue size. 29. The PCE facility shall be provided at the time of the bond issue and shall be irrevocable. PCE cannot be provided by way of guarantee. 30. As the purpose of PCE by REs is to enable wide investor participation in the corporate bond market, REs shall not invest in corporate bonds which are credit enhanced by other REs. They may, however, provide other need based credit facilities (funded and/ or non-funded) to the corporate/ SPV. 31. REs may offer PCE only in respect of bonds whose pre-enhanced rating are not lower than “BBB” minus as issued by accredited External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI). 32. To be eligible for PCE, corporate bonds shall be rated by a minimum of two ECAI at all times. 33. The rating reports, both initial and subsequent, shall disclose both standalone credit rating (i.e., rating without taking into account the effect of PCE) as well as the enhanced credit rating (taking into account the effect of PCE). 34. So long as the exposure of a RE to a project loan is classified as standard and the borrower is not in any financial distress (Refer to Annex 1 of Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7, 2019 for indicative list of signs of financial difficulty), providing a commercially priced PCE to enhance the rating of a bond issue, whose proceeds replace, in whole or in part, the RE’s project loan, would not amount to restructuring. .35. The PCE shall be available only for servicing the bond and not for any other purpose (such as funding acquisition of additional assets by the corporate, meeting part of the project cost or meeting recurring expenses of the corporate or servicing other lenders/ creditors to the project etc.), irrespective of the seniority of claims of other creditors in relation to the bond holders. 36. In case the PCE facility is partly drawn and interest accrues on the same, the unpaid accrued interest shall be excluded from the calculation of the remaining amount available for drawing. B. Balance Sheet treatment, capital requirements, exposure and asset classification norms for exposures arising on account of providing PCE 37. PCE facilities to the extent drawn shall be treated as an on-balance sheet advance in the balance sheet. Undrawn facilities would be an off-balance sheet item and reported under ‘Contingent Liability – Others’. 38. The capital required to be maintained by the RE providing PCE for a given bond issue shall be based on the PCE amount and the applicable risk weight for the RE corresponding to the pre- enhanced rating of the bond. To illustrate, in the case of a SCB, assume that the total bond size is ₹100 and pre-enhanced rating of the bond is BBB. In this scenario, the applicable risk weight at the pre-enhanced rating of BBB is 100%. The capital requirement (assuming CRAR of 9%) for varying amount of PCE, would, therefore be: PCE Amount (₹) Capital Requirement for PCE provider (₹) 20 1.8 (20*100%*9%) 30 2.7 (30*100%*9%) 40 3.6 (40*100%*9%) 50 4.5 (50*100%*9%) 39. For the purpose of capital computation in the books of PCE provider, lower of the two pre-enhanced credit ratings shall be reckoned. 40. It is possible that the credit rating of the bond changes during the lifetime of the bond, necessitating a change in the capital requirement. Therefore, the rating of the bond shall be monitored regularly, and capital requirement adjusted in the following manner: In case of change in the pre-enhanced rating of the bond, the capital required shall be recalculated based on the risk weight applicable to revised pre-enhanced rating, subject to a floor, i.e., the capital requirement on the PCE at the time of issuance of the PCE enhanced bonds. As long as the bond outstanding amount exceeds the aggregate PCE (drawn and contingent non-funded) offered, the capital held shall not be less than the amount required to be held at the time of issuance of the PCE enhanced bond. However, once the bond outstanding has amortised below the aggregate PCE amount, the capital can be computed taking into account the outstanding bond amount. In situations where the pre-enhanced rating of the bond slips below investment grade (BBB minus), full capital to the extent of PCE provided shall be maintained by all REs, including NBFCs and HFCs. 41. In all circumstances, the capital computed for PCE as mentioned above and required to be maintained by the PCE provider, shall be capped by the total amount of PCE provided. 42. In a waterfall mechanism, Credit Enhancement (CE) gets drawn only in a contingent situation of cash flow shortfall for servicing a debt/ bond etc., and not in the normal course of business. Hence, such an event is indicative of financial distress of the project. Keeping this aspect in view, a drawn tranche of the contingent PCE facility shall be required to be repaid within 30 days from the date of its drawal (due date). The facility shall be treated as NPA if it remains outstanding for 90 days or more from the due date and provided for as per the usual asset classification and provisioning norms. In that event, the RE’s other facilities to the borrower shall also be classified as NPA as per extant guidelines. 43. The PCE providing RE shall observe the following exposure limits: PCE exposure by a RE to a single counterparty or group of counterparties shall be within the overall regulatory exposure limits applicable to each category of RE. The aggregate PCE exposure of a RE shall not exceed 20 per cent of its Tier 1 capital. C. Additional conditions for providing PCE to bonds of NBFCs and HFCs 44. The tenor of the bond issued by NBFCs/ HFCs for which PCE is provided shall not be less than three years. 45. The proceeds from the bonds backed by PCE from REs shall only be utilized for refinancing the existing debt of the NBFCs/ HFCs. REs shall introduce appropriate mechanisms to monitor and ensure that the end-use condition is met. 46. The exposure of a RE by way of PCEs to bonds issued by each such NBFC/ HFC shall be restricted to one percent of capital funds of the RE within the extant single/ group borrower exposure limits. D. Other Aspects of PCE 47. The effect of the PCE on the bond rating shall be disclosed in the bond offer document i.e., the rating of the bond without and with the PCE shall be disclosed. 48. REs shall ensure that the project assets, created out of the bond issue for which PCE has been provided by them, and the cash flows from the project are ring fenced through an escrow account mechanism administered under a bond trustee arrangement. The manner in which security interest in the project assets would be shared by the lenders to the project, bond holders and REs providing the PCE and the manner in which the project cash flows would be shared for servicing loans, if any, and the bonds and PCE, shall be decided and agreed upon before the issue of bonds and shall be properly documented. 49. The project shall have a robust and viable financial structure even before the credit enhancement is taken into account. Nevertheless, while providing PCE, REs shall exercise necessary due diligence and credit appraisal, including making their own internal credit analysis/ rating. 50. REs shall honour the full PCE commitment irrespective of the asset classification of the concerned borrower’s credit facilities. 51. All extant regulatory prescriptions for credit and investment exposures by REs, unless specified otherwise in this Direction, shall continue to apply. Chapter - V Exclusions and Other Aspects 52. These Directions have been issued without prejudice to Directions under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999; Foreign Exchange Management (Guarantees) Regulations, 2000, notified vide Notification No. FEMA 8/2000-RB dated May 03, 2000 ; as amended from time to time. 53. Notwithstanding clause 52 above, RE shall comply with all the related regulatory norms including exposure norms issued by RBI as amended from time to time. 54.

      "summary": "It gives me immense pleasure to participate in the FIBAC annual conference for this year. It brings together distinguished thought leaders and stakeholders of the Indian economy and our financial ecosystem to deliberate on critical and contemporary issues facing the economic landscape of our country. The topic of the Conference “Charting New Frontiers” is very relevant and topical as we respond to the new challenges of tariffs and geopolitical uncertainties. I am sure that the discussions in this conference will be very fruitful and provide deeper insights and guidance to all stakeholders, especially businesses, regulators and governments. This is all the more important as we strive to contribute in our journey for a Viksit Bharat by 2047. I compliment FICCI and IBA for organising this annual conference. I. India’s’ Story of Resilience and Stability 2. We celebrated our 79th Independence Day ten days ago. We have made huge progress since our independence. Our advancement spreads across sectors – education, health, agriculture, industries, infrastructure, science and technology, defence, governance, finance, etc. The Indian economy has expanded manifold. It continues to be a symbol of resilience and hope. The achievements of the Indian economy despite unprecedented challenges in the last few years are undoubtedly creditable and widely recognised. 3. The Indian economy today is characterised by robust macroeconomic fundamentals. Indian economy rebounded strongly post-COVID and recorded an average annual growth of around 8 per cent during the last four years (2021-22 to 2024-25), supported by strong domestic demand – both private consumption and fixed investment - amidst challenging global economic conditions. The IMF has projected that India will be the fastest growing major economy. We are all set to become the third-largest economy in the coming years. Inflation levels have generally reduced after implementation of the inflation targeting. Headline inflation recorded an eight year low of 1.6 per cent in July this year. 4. India’s fiscal situation too has seen significant improvement after the post-COVID counter-cyclical fiscal response with a focus on the quality of expenditure. The union government’s fiscal deficit to GDP ratio is budgeted to moderate from a high of 9.2 per cent to 4.4 per cent of GDP in 2025-26. Quality of expenditure has improved. Central government’s effective capital expenditure which includes capital grants-in-aid to the states is budgeted at 4.3 per cent of GDP for 2025-26. Corporate balance-sheets are healthy. Banks are well capitalised, with sufficient liquidity buffers, robust asset quality and reasonable profitability. My compliments to the industry, especially the banking sector for this impressive performance. 5. India’s external sector has also strengthened considerably over the last decade. The current account deficit (CAD) has remained well within the sustainable limit in recent years - it was 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2024-25. This is due to robust services exports and strong remittance receipts despite higher merchandise trade deficit. Capital flows have generally exceeded the CAD, adding to our foreign exchange reserves which stood at 695 billion USD as on August 15, 2025, providing merchandise imports cover of over 11 months. 6. Proactive fiscal and monetary policies, structural reforms, massive upscaling of both physical and digital infrastructure, improved governance and enhanced productivity and competitiveness, have all contributed to this impressive performance. 7. We are at a critical juncture as we navigate the choppy global economic environment characterised by heightened trade uncertainty and persisting geopolitical tensions. We need to push the frontiers of growth. We all must step up our efforts to address the emerging challenges and capitalise on the opportunities ahead. Generations of freedom fighters gave us a free India, a Swatantra Bharat. We need to now work for a Samridh Bharat, a prosperous India. In this backdrop, I thought it appropriate to speak on what we need to do together to further build on our economic development. I have divided this into five major areas - monetary policy, regulation, financial inclusion, customer service and technology. II. Monetary Policy 8. The role of monetary policy in economic prosperity is critical. One of the major conduits of macroeconomic stability in India during recent years despite multiple shocks, has been the decline of inflation. Sharp spikes in food prices, volatile oil prices, global supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions could have significantly stoked inflation. However, proactive policy measures by the Reserve Bank, including timely interest rate adjustments and liquidity management, alongside prudent supply side measures by the government, have helped contain generalisation of price pressures. Anchored inflation expectations too have supported stable consumption patterns and improved investor confidence. The primary objective of monetary policy in terms of price stability has significantly contributed to the strength of India's macroeconomic fundamentals. At the same time, the Reserve Bank has not lost sight of the objective of growth. For example, before covid, when growth was slowing, and in recent months, when inflation was benign and growth needed to be supported, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the policy repo rate. We will continue to conduct monetary policy with the primary objective of price stability keeping in view the objective of growth. III. Regulation of Banks and NBFCs Importance of regulation 9. Despite increase in other sources of credit, the banks, NBFCs, HFCs and AIFIs regulated by RBI still provide about 73 per cent of the credit needs of the real economy with banks providing about 53 per cent. This shows the continued importance of RBI regulated entities in meeting the credit needs of the economy. 10. It has been our endeavour to regulate these entities with an aim to ensure that the financial system remains healthy and grows sustainably. Here I would like to mention that regulations are akin to friction. If friction is too less, one will fall while walking and if it is too much, progress will be impeded. Regulations provide the necessary friction to promote financial stability and safety of depositors hard-earned money. However, stringent regulations may impede growth of the economy. The art of regulation-making lies in finding the right balance between safety and growth - “the right amount of friction”. Pursuit of this balance, or optimal regulation, is indeed our constant endeavour in the RBI. Our approach to regulation making 11. Our regulatory framework is based on five principles or characteristics: First, we have gradually pivoted from being prescriptive to largely principle based. Second, we have espoused the idea of proportionality to strike a fine balance between costs and benefits of regulation. Impact analysis is an integral component of this. Third, we are consultative in our approach. We realise that we need to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders. We organise outreach with industry, associations, banks, NBFCs and other regulated entities. We have also operationalised ‘connect to regulate’ for direct connection with our stakeholders. We seek your active support in giving feedback and suggestions for better regulation-making. Fourth, we attempt to be evidence based. We gather information through our interaction and outreach as also through our supervisory teams. Some of the REs may be feeling the burden of our information seek from them. But, information is important for regulation-making. We seek your assistance in this regard. Fifth, we are agile and we adapt with change in context, availability of new information, and the evolving landscape. We have not hesitated in relaxing a stringent rule, once deemed necessary, if the context changes and the cost-benefit balance reverses. 12. What we do as a matter of practice, has now been institutionalised through the recently released “Framework for Formulation of Regulations” which codifies this approach, that I just highlighted. Regulatory Developments in Recent Past 13. Entering into this calendar year, we have rationalised the applicable prudential norms for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) to accord flexibility in their operations; we restored the applicable risk weights for lending to NBFCs as risks abated. Similarly, the provisioning requirement for government guaranteed security receipts were reviewed in view of their sovereign nature. We have updated the priority sector lending (PSL) guidelines to boost credit to underserved segments. We rationalised run-off factors, which will potentially lead to a cumulative improvement in LCR of about 6 percentage points for the system as a whole. Similarly, we have come out with comprehensively rationalised regulatory framework for investments in Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), co-lending, non-fund-based facilities, project finance, and gold loans to name a few. These are examples of how we have been agile, consultative, evidence-oriented, principle-based, and proportional in our regulation-making. Proposed regulations 14. Going forward, we will continue this approach. Our focus will be three-fold. First and foremost, we will continue strengthening financial stability. We intend to implement Basel III guidelines for market, credit and operational risk from 1.4.2027, for which credit risk and ECL related draft guidelines are proposed to be issued soon. The Forms of Business circular is also planned to be finalised quickly. 15. Second, we will endeavour to enhance ease of doing business. We have already rationalised the returns that regulated entities have to submit to us. We are in the process of consolidating all the regulations for various categories of regulated entities. In our pursuit of making principle-based framework, we have given autonomy to the board of the respective entities to frame policies. While the intent was to leave detailed policy-making to the judgement of the bank, it has resulted in overburdening the boards of the regulated entities. Therefore, we are trying to rationalise the macro-policies that need to be approved by the Boards of the regulated entities, and leave the procedural and routine matters with the management so that the Board gets quality time to deliberate on strategic and important matters. 16. Third, we are examining measures to expand bank credit towards productive sectors and reduce cost of intermediation. 17. As announced earlier, we propose to set up a Regulatory Review Cell with the mandate to review each regulation in a comprehensive, objective, systematic and structured manner. The objective of the review shall be to assess each regulation with focus on efficiency; its impact in terms of cost and benefit; its requirement in the current context and market realities; consistency and clarity especially across different regulations; and potential of unaddressed or emerging risks, among other things. The Cell shall organise its work in such a manner that each regulation is reviewed at least once in every 5-7 years. The Cell will interact with major financial sector industry bodies. IV. Financial Inclusion 18. Economic development is incomplete if it is not inclusive. We believe in the adage “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together” . We need to take everyone together and especially those at the bottom of the pyramid. We have made considerable progress in financial inclusion over the years as reflected in the Financial Inclusion (FI)-Index constructed by the RBI which is based on the three dimensions of financial inclusion, ‘Access’, ‘Usage’ and ‘Quality’. Notwithstanding the considerable progress, FI-Index point towards scope for further improvement in usage and quality while also addressing gaps in access. 19. Let us remember we have a responsibility to all the people of our country, almost two-thirds, of which resides in rural areas. While, we have provided banking access to almost all villages within a radius of 5 kilometres, there is scope to further enhance it. Business Correspondents (BCs) are an effective channel for providing services in sparsely populated areas of our country. This channel needs to be strengthened to improve the quality, consistency and reach of financial services. Not only is there is a scope to augment them, but there is also a need to train them and expand the number of services they can provide. On one hand, this will make the BCs financially viable and sustainable; on the other hand, it will improve quality and reach of services. 20. Towards the objective of financial inclusion and to ensure uninterrupted access to the financial services, banks have launched a country-wide campaign from July 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025 at Gram Panchayat level. I urge all the banks to step up their efforts through these camps towards enhancing the coverage of re-KYC and the social security schemes. I also seek your support to Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs) and Centres for Financial Literacy (CFLs), being operated under our aegis. 21. Another area of focus is the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector which contributes significantly to employment, exports and output. There is a significant credit gap to MSMEs. Banks and NBFCs should make special efforts to boost formal credit to them. They should leverage the public digital infrastructure like the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), in this endeavour. V. Customer Service 22. Consumers are the raison detre or the purpose of our being. Customer-centricity is fundamental for sustainable growth of any business. Conduct related regulations 23. At the Reserve Bank, we are passionately driven by the objective of customer-centricity. Key Fact Statement and integrating explicit conduct related aspects in our regulations are some examples in this regard. Recently released revised guidelines on pre-payment charges and draft guidelines on settlement of claims in respect of deceased customers also reflect our customer-first approach. Consumer service by REs 24. Similarly, regulated entities must focus on excellent and seamless service and experience, creating customer delight. They need to be transparent, fair, and responsive. While digitalization is a key, the human aspect too cannot be neglected, for which training, especially on behavioural aspects, needs to be emphasized. 25. I had on an earlier occasion urged the Banks to enable the use of CKYCR at KYC touch points. I had also highlighted that the number of grievances escalating to the RBI Ombudsman is very high. It was also expected that each RE has an effective grievance redressal mechanism, where officers are suitably empowered to take decisions in consumer interest. I exhort the regulated entities to make further improvements in these areas. 26. Further, we are in the process of reviewing the Internal Ombudsman framework at the level of REs to further strengthen it and ensure that complaints get resolved effectively within the institution itself. We are also reviewing the RB-IOS to enhance its effectiveness, transparency and customer-centricity as an alternate grievance redressal mechanism. Further, we intend to enhance the consistency and adequacy of compensation awarded under the Ombudsman framework. We also plan to expand the set of services, non-timely provision of which may be liable for payment of penalty. 27. Consumer’s trust is vital not only for the regulated entity but also for the stability and resilience of the banking system. To build and maintain trust, it is essential that regulated entities (REs) put in place a robust and effective mechanism to redress the grievances of aggrieved customers proactively in a just, transparent, timely and affordable manner. They should periodically assess the types of complaints, conduct a root cause analysis and implement systemic corrective measures in product design, processes, and employee conduct. It is further suggested that customer satisfaction related KPIs are included in performance appraisal and variable pay of key functionaries. VI. Technology to enhance credit and efficiency 28. Use of technology is a sine quo non for any business. It has become the core engine for improving decision making and customer service, moving far beyond its traditional role of driving efficiency. Regulated entities need to accelerate its adoption as they strive to enhance credit and reduce costs. 29. RBI too has adopted technology in all its functions. The Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem is empowering customers with control over their financial data. ULI is making credit delivery seamless, making it truly transformative. We will further strengthen these platforms. We have implemented PRAVAAH platform for improving services to regulated entities. We will continue to embrace technology including AI and ML and expect our regulated entities too invest in it. VII. Concluding remarks 30. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that while we might seem to be on opposite sides – with the regulated entities trying to accelerate growth and the regulators focusing on stability, we actually have the same objectives. We are in the same team with a shared vision of a Viksit Bharat . There is no tussle between financial stability and growth. Financial stability and price stability do not inhibit growth. Far from it, they are essential for sustainable growth. 31. I look forward to working together with the regulated entities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of financial intermediation to ensure that the due benefits reach the people of our nation. Likewise, on the demand side, I urge the industry to invest boldly and champion the entrepreneurial spirit that defines our nation. At a time, when balance sheet of banks and corporates are at their best, they should come together and drive the animal spirits to create an investment cycle which is so important at this juncture. 32. Lastly, in your respective roles, I urge you not to ever lose sight of the people you are serving. At the cost of sounding a bit sermonic, I must say that if there is any doubt in your mind, espouse the philosophies of Gandhi’s Talisman , or Antyodaya . Take decisions keeping in mind how your actions will impact the most vulnerable person of our country. 33. I wish the conference a huge success. Thank you. Namaskar. Jai Hind.",

      "summary": "Participants of the ‘Management Development Programme on Financial Market Regulations’, Professors, ladies, and gentlemen. A very good morning to all of you! 2. At the outset, I would like to thank IIM, Kozhikode for inviting me here. It is a pleasure to address such a diverse gathering, ranging from policy veterans to important stakeholders across the financial landscape. The contents of programme span the issues around the regulatory framework of a diverse mix of entities operating in the financial markets including banks, securities firms, and insurance entities. 3. Financial markets span a wide array of products starting with money markets, G Secs, forex, equities, commodities, and derivatives. These products are traded bilaterally, over the counter, or increasingly on electronic trading platforms or on exchanges. The entities are diverse, and they are active in many of these markets. They are regulated by different regulators depending on the nature of entities and/or their activities. The markets are interconnected with spillover risks from one set of market activities into another, increasingly becoming a point of concern from the point of view of financial stability. In my remarks today, I would like to, therefore, share a few perspectives on the need for market and entity regulations and their interplay, the tools employed by the regulators and the challenges faced in framing regulations for a rapidly evolving and interlinked financial ecosystem; and conclude by sharing a few thoughts on the way forward. The role and evolution of financial sector regulations in India 4. To set the stage, it is essential to start by tracing the evolution of financial sector regulations in India, which commenced with the establishment of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 1935. The Bank’s remit was expanded in 1949 to cover regulation and supervision of commercial banks 2 . This was succeeded by empowering it to regulate and supervise non-banking institutions 3 now commonly referred to as Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in 1964 4 and thereafter Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in 1966 5 . 5. The year 1991 is extremely significant as it ushered in key economic reforms which helped to transform and grow our economy. The reforms in the financial sector started in a way, with the implementation of the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee on financial sector reforms. The entry of private banks, introduction of prudential norms for banks, and alignment of capital adequacy requirements with global standards based on the recommendations of the Committee and conferring of statutory powers to the Reserve Bank to exercise greater oversight over the NBFCs were important policy landmarks during this period. This together with the subsequent changes in the monetary policy framework 6 , the liberalisation of the exchange control regime and the grant of powers to regulate the Payment and Settlement Systems as well as the money, foreign exchange, and government securities (G-Sec) markets to the Reserve Bank, have collectively influenced the changes in the approach to regulation making at the Reserve Bank. 6. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was statutorily entrusted with regulation and development of the securities market in the year 1992 7 . The subsequent decades saw establishment of new financial sector regulators in the form of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to oversee the regulation of the insurance and reinsurance sectors and of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) for pension funds. More recently in 2020, the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) was created to regulate and promote financial products, services, and institutions within India’s International Financial Services Centres. Collectively, these regulators play a critical role in the journey of transforming India’s financial system into a more resilient, market-driven, and consumer-centric ecosystem, while facilitating sustainable economic growth of the country. Approach for Regulation making 7. The market-oriented laissez-faire approach towards Regulation of financial markets with minimal regulations operates on the assumption that self-regulation will be effective. However, this view has been contested by some economists and policymakers who argue that regulation is not just necessary but essential. They contend that the idea of inherently self-correcting markets is more of an ideological fad than a factual occurrence, and that effective oversight is crucial to ensure stability, transparency, and protection of the financial sector against systemic risks. Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz in his influential book Freefall: Free Markets and the Sinking of the Global Economy writes, “The crisis has made it clear that self-regulation – which the financial industry promoted and which I view as an oxymoron – doesn’t work.” Time and again it has been proven that financial regulation is essential not only to prevent market failures, but also to protect consumers and safeguard the stability and resilience of the broader economy, particularly in times of crisis. The common misconception that regulation inherently imposes restrictive barriers, is inaccurate. A well-designed financial oversight framework underpinned by thoughtfully crafted regulations not only ensures a level playing field but also fosters sustainable growth and development. How do we regulate financial systems 8 8. Before delving into the specific approaches to regulation-making, it is important to first reflect on the broader frameworks for financial system regulation, especially considering that alternative models of financial oversight are in vogue. 9. The regulatory oversight architecture for financial systems can be broadly categorised into three main models . The first model is known as ‘sectoral or traditional model’ , in which each of the financial sector authorities is responsible for both - prudential and conduct aspects of the specific financial sector, i.e., banking, insurance, securities and market integrity. This approach has been followed by countries like India, Brazil, Hong Kong and Mexico and remains the most commonly used model around the world. However, challenges arise in such a model while dealing with financial conglomerates, whose activities blur the boundaries between different types of financial institutions. Such trade-offs can be smoothed by introducing complementary arrangements, like those adopted by Indian Financial Sector Regulators (FSRs), which I will discuss later. 10. An alternative approach is the ‘integrated model’ , where a single agency oversees all oversight functions including regulations across the finance industry. This model was adopted by Singapore in 1984 as a consequence of reforms in financial oversight architecture. Later Scandinavian countries adopted similar models, followed by the UK, which established a single Financial Services Authority (FSA) in 1997. Further, countries like Russia, Japan, Germany and South Korea have adopted this model in their financial architecture. While this approach offers a cohesive and streamlined framework for overseeing the financial sector, enabling unified decision-making, reduced regulatory arbitrage, and improved co-ordination, it may present some operational challenges like risk of possible single point of regulatory failure, dilution of sectoral focus and reduced flexibility in addressing the needs of different sub-sectors. 11. The third model involves grouping responsibilities either according to regulatory and supervisory goals or according to sectors, i.e., partially integrated approach . The ‘Twin Peaks’ model is an example of this, where two separate agencies manage each of the prudential oversight and conduct of business for all types of financial institutions. This model was first adopted in Australia in 1997, followed by Netherlands in 2002 and thereafter introduced in Canada and South Africa. After the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the UK restructured its regulatory framework by replacing the integrated model with Twin Peaks model by bifurcating FSA in two institutions - the Financial Conduct Authority which focuses on market conduct, and the Prudential Regulation Authority (under the aegis of Central Bank) responsible for the prudential regulation and supervision of banks, building societies, credit unions, insurers and major investment firms. The Twin Peaks model leverages potential synergies arising in the prudential or the business conduct oversight of various types of financial institutions but faces similar challenges of lack of sectoral focus as in the integrated model and co-ordination challenges as in sectoral model. 12. The Two Agency model is another example of the partially integrated model where one agency is responsible for the regulation and supervision of both solvency and conduct of business for banks and insurance companies, and a second agency is responsible for market integrity and the securities business. It is currently in place in jurisdictions such as France, Italy, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, etc. 13. The models in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) have special characteristics. While in the US functions have been assigned to various agencies at the federal and state level, in the EU, countries within the euro zone share a single prudential supervisory authority for significant banks. More recently, after the GFC, the macroprudential policy and resolution functions were the areas which were added to the financial oversight architecture, which may or may not involve separate agencies depending on the type of model adopted. 14. Each model includes trade-offs between synergies and potential conflicts of interest and challenges. The decision to adopt a financial oversight model depends on the structure and evolution of the financial sector, legal, cultural, and political economy considerations as well as past experiences like dealing with financial crises. Whichever be the model, one of the key features of any financial oversight architecture is the Central Bank remains the primary or lead authority. Its leadership in coordinating with other regulatory entities reinforces the coherence, resilience, and credibility of the overall financial oversight architecture. 15. Let me now touch upon the approaches adopted by regulators for the regulation-making process. While there may be differing views on the most apt approach to regulations, there is no ‘one size fit all’ approach. Regulators use different approaches and tools to address varied types of problems for effective regulation. Principle vs. Rule vs. Outcome based regulation 16. Principle based regulation is qualitative and uses high-level statements with an explanation of the underlying intent. It gives flexibility and freedom to a Regulated Entity (RE) to innovate by developing new products and services without being constrained by prescriptive rules. However, it is open to subjective interpretation and can therefore pose challenges for both REs and supervisors, thus limiting enforcement and accountability. It may also be less effective in areas like consumer protection, where clear and actionable directions are essential. In the context of Reserve Bank as a banking regulator, the Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets 9 is an example of principle-based regulation. 17. Rule-based regulation, on the other hand, requires an RE to comply with specific, prescriptive requirements. It leads to better clarity, compliance, and consistency, as it simplifies the understanding of regulations for an RE and consumer alike. However, it may lead to a ‘check-the-box’ mentality, resulting in compliance by REs in letter but not in spirit. The REs may also face challenges when dealing with complex and dynamic issues where nuanced judgment is required. The Master Directions on Priority Sector Lending – Targets and Classification 10 can be considered as an example of a rule-based regulation issued by the Bank. 18. Another approach which has gained prominence of late is the outcome-based regulation, with focus on desired outcomes or results rather than prescribing specific processes and tools. This approach sets \"what\" is the desired outcome, while providing flexibility on \"how\" to achieve it. The RBI’s Directions on Digital Lending 11 emphasise on the desired outcome, i.e., transparency and fairness for borrowers, rather than getting into specifics like lending rates or methods. 19. Striking the right balance amongst these approaches is critical to creating an enabling, and effective regulatory environment while encouraging innovation, given the complexities of today’s dynamic financial landscape. Activity vs. Entity based regulation 20. Activity-based regulation prescribes regulatory obligations for specific activities, independent of the entity undertaking them. It works on the principle of “same activity, same risk, same rules”. The Directions issued on Financial Services provided by Banks 12 can be categorised as activity-based regulation. 21. In contrast, entity-based regulation aims to bolster the resilience of activities with focus on the entity. This approach encompasses governance, prudential and conduct requirements, reinforced by supervisory interventions. Given that an entity’s overall resilience is shaped by the composition of its activities, entity-based regulations place targeted restrictions – an essential feature of such regulation. The prudential norms on capital adequacy are in nature of entity-based regulation. 22. Given the distinct regulatory domains, and keeping in view the objective of financial stability, regulators often adopt a hybrid approach that integrates elements of both activity-based and entity-based regulation. Such a tailored regulatory framework enhances the comprehensiveness and resilience of oversight mechanisms. It allows regulators to respond more effectively to market developments and emerging risks, thereby strengthening the overall regulatory architecture and promoting a sound, stable, and inclusive financial system. 13 Rules based vs. Risk based approach 14 23. Rules-based regulation focusses on adherence to regulatory prescriptions regardless of the level of risk. Though beneficial at times, the approach should factor in principle of proportionality, as not all entities carry same amount of risk to financial stability or consumer protection. 24. Adopting a risk-based approach enables regulators to frame regulations that are both effective and proportionate in the dynamic financial environment of today. This also helps in directing scarce regulatory and supervisory resources in optimal manner while also fostering innovation and financial inclusion. The Scale Based Regulation issued by RBI for Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) 15 and revised regulatory framework for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) 16 , can be thought of as recent examples of a risk-based approach. Market vs. entity regulation 25. Market-based regulation focuses on the overall structure and functioning of financial markets, while entity-based regulation deals with the prudential norms, conduct, solvency, and internal risk management of individual financial institutions. Although each Financial Sector Regulator (FSR) such as the RBI, SEBI, IRDAI, PFRDA, or IFSCA has its distinct regulatory domain, activities of many of their REs overlap. Depending on their activities, these entities may fall under multiple regulatory frameworks, resulting in differential oversight and heightened operational complexity. For example, a mutual fund or an insurance company participating in government securities market or a bank participating in corporate bond market. To address such overlaps, FSRs are increasingly adopting a co-ordinated approach to regulation and supervision, with the broader goal of ensuring financial stability. Challenges in regulation making 26. Regulation making is a complex process starting from identification of risks or gaps in existing regulations, evaluation of options to address them and finally coming out with an appropriate and effective regulation which is intended to address the risks for the entity and for the financial system (prudence, resilience and stability) and/or empower the consumers and ensure fair conduct amongst entities (conduct issues). While treading this path, the regulators are often confronted with many challenges. Let me highlight a few of them. Balancing innovation and stability 17 27. Innovation in the financial sector has brought about transformative changes. However, the rapid pace of innovation, also leads to regulatory gaps or grey areas. Innovations often take shape of new business models and partnerships with third parties, who are outside the regulatory ambit of the FSRs. It is the job of the regulator to plug these loopholes by framing rules in such a manner that allows innovation to thrive but provide sufficient guardrails to ensure that financial system remains stable and resilient. The regulators are therefore adopting a more agile and forward-looking approach - like the development of regulatory sandboxes and enhancing dialogue with key stakeholders for integrating the new players into the regulatory framework, while being mindful of financial stability. Keeping pace with emerging risks and technologies 28. The regulators need to keep pace with dynamically changing markets and deal with emerging risks and technologies. This requires regulators to devise approaches to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and also ensuring the safety of the financial system, while providing space for innovation. I would like to highlight two examples of the challenges faced by the regulators. (I) Climate risk 29. Addressing climate change not only requires transition towards sustainability, but also integration of climate related financial risks into regulatory framework. Regulators across the world are debating whether climate risk warrants a separate framework or should it be embedded within existing risk categories. There is also ongoing discussion on whether climate risk oversight should form part of Pillar 2 (supervisory review), or Pillar 1 (capital and liquidity requirements). This continues to engage the attention of the standard setting bodies, industry and other stakeholders and there is a need to strike right balance to harmonize environmental stewardship with maintenance of financial stability. 18 (II) Emerging technologies 30. New technologies improve ease of doing business, reduce operational and compliance costs, but they also pose challenges for regulation. There are three primary challenges in regulating these technologies: (i) the unpredictable nature of business models that rely on emerging technologies, (ii) data privacy, security, ownership, and control, and (iii) the artificial intelligence (AI) conundrum. 19 One example of new business models is Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) model which increases scale and speed of distribution of financial products but could also lead to significant business conduct risks. Regulators face a dilemma: whether to come out with a framework before such financial innovations happen or allow markets to develop, risking unanticipated systemic risks and exploitative consumer practices. 20 Additionally, regulators must navigate capacity constraints and legal complexities in crafting effective regulations. 31. Here too, we have adopted a cautious approach while coming out with regulations like digital lending directions covering partnerships between FinTechs (as Lending Service Providers) and REs, introduction of Video based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP) etc., in these emerging technology areas. The RBI had constituted a committee to develop a robust, comprehensive, and adaptable Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of Artificial Intelligence (FREE-AI) for the Financial Sector 21 which has come out with a principle-based approach to AI adoption in the financial sector. Reducing regulatory burden and ensuring compliance 32. India has made notable progress in improving its business environment over the years, however, there is still ample scope for further improvement. Regulatory burden and compliance costs pose challenges to REs, more so for smaller REs. Regulators not only need to do a delicate balancing act of reducing the burden and compliance cost for the REs but also need to ensure that it does not hinder the efficient functioning of markets. The Reserve Bank has pioneered some initiatives over time, which I would like to highlight: To reduce compliance burden, RBI had constituted a Regulatory Review Authority (RRA) in 1999, followed by establishment of the second RRA (RRA 2.0) in 2021. The RRA 2.0 led to withdrawal or repeal of a total of 1,673 circulars, and discontinuation/ online conversion/ merger of 78 returns. The ‘Connect 2 Regulate’ Platform has been introduced on RBI’s website to broaden involvement of members of the public and stakeholders in policy formulation and review, thereby making the process more consultative. The ‘PRAVAAH’ (Platform for Regulatory Application, VAlidation and AutHorisation), a secure and centralised web-based portal for any individual or entity to seek authorisation, license or regulatory approval on any reference made to the Reserve Bank has been launched to enhance the efficiency of processes related to granting of regulatory approvals. To formalise participatory and responsive regulation making and demonstrating RBI’s commitment to enhanced transparency and consultative approach a comprehensive Framework for the Formulation of Regulations was issued on May 7, 2025 22 . It lays down broad principles for drafting, amending, and reviewing regulations by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank is in the process of setting up a Regulatory Review Cell that would review all regulations every five to seven years. Data, capacity and resource constraints 33. Another area which continues to engage the attention of the regulators is the lack of precise data to effectively formulate new policies. Rapid evolution of financial technologies has led to an exponential increase in the volume of data generated, however, challenges remain with respect to comprehensiveness, credibility, and accuracy of such information. Though regulators are equipping themselves with the latest tools and skills, the pace at which requirements are evolving is breath-taking. This requires continued capacity building within the regulators. Inter-Regulatory co-ordination 34. As alluded to earlier, the Indian financial sector is characterised by significant heterogeneity, comprising of varied players governed by multiple FSRs, each responsible for entities operating under its purview. This demands robust and effective inter-regulatory co-ordination to facilitate consistent policy making. To address this challenge, an integrated approach to oversight has been adopted by the Financial Sector Regulators (FSRs) for financial conglomerates operating across multiple sectors, based on the ‘lead regulator’ principle. Joint supervision and periodic bilateral/multilateral discussions with such financial conglomerates are some of the tools adopted as a part of this approach. 35. The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) headed by the Finance Minister and its Sub-Committee, headed by RBI Governor, where all heads of FSRs are represented, provides a platform for combined assessment of risks from the financial stability perspective and plays a pivotal role, for inter-regulatory co-ordination on the matters where there is overlap among FSRs. Such platforms help in further strengthening inter-regulatory co-ordination for wider development of financial sector in India. 36. However, there could be certain areas, such as increasing partnerships between the technological firms and the REs, where activities may fall outside the remit of any of the FSRs, exposing the REs to risks arising out of these activities. Addressing such risks, many a times becomes challenging for regulators and requires effective co-ordination among international regulators/ supervisors so that they do not lead to a systemic crisis. This remains a complex area for regulators, given the concerns around privacy, confidentiality, and enforcement. Way forward Principle and outcome-based approach 37. There is no perfect regulatory approach, however, principle and outcome-based regulation is generally found to be more suitable for mature markets. Nevertheless, even developed economies use rule-based framework when it comes to safeguarding interests of consumers. We, at the Reserve Bank are gradually shifting towards principle and outcome-based regulations, as it gives operational flexibility to the REs for conduct of their operations and tailor their activities to their unique needs, while adhering to the regulatory framework for delivering the outcomes expected from them. Forward looking and proactive approach 38. Regulators are often confronted with complex challenges while framing regulations, necessitating adoption of a forward-looking approach. Addressing emerging risks calls for nuanced and adaptive strategies to ensure resilience. Regulators must adopt a more proactive mindset to help build a financial system that is both resilient and adaptable. Being proactive entails embracing innovation and fully leveraging data and technology. They need to further leverage technology to enhance their efficiency - both internal and supervisory, carry out regulatory horizon risk scanning and boost regulatory effectiveness. Usage of rapidly evolving technologies and collaboration with domain experts is need of the hour for the regulators to stay abreast of the evolving changes in the financial system. Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) 39. Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA) are increasingly being recognised as essential tools for policy makers, enabling the development of policies that are grounded in evidence, clear in their purpose, proportionate in design, and responsive to real world conditions. These tools can be useful to strike a balance, by guarding against both unnecessary compliance burden and regulatory gaps, while boosting public confidence and enhancing international standing. Two essential elements of RIA are (i) Cost Benefit Analysis of the regulations, which can be evaluated either through qualitative or quantitative parameters or through a mix of both and (ii) consultation with a broad spectrum of stakeholders. While the latter leads to enhanced transparency, fostering trust, and improvement in the quality and effectiveness of the regulations, the former helps determine the optimal solution for addressing the problem while ensuring efficient allocation of resources. 40. Another important area is timely review of regulatory prescriptions and reporting mechanisms with a view to streamlining/ rationalising them and making them more effective. Such timely reviews not only reduce compliance requirements but also offer the regulators an opportunity to review the appropriateness of regulations in line with evolving market practices and developments. Regulators should endeavour to adopt best practices in their regulatory approaches, both ex-ante, to assess potential impact and avoid unintended consequences and ex-post, to assess actual impact and support course correction while enhancing future rule design, so that together, they ensure that regulation is both “right the first time” and “kept right over time”. Enhancing compliance 41. The regulators should have a broader vision of enhancing compliance by REs to make it easier for them to comply with regulations. This can be done by simplifying regulations, enhancing their clarity and removing redundancies and duplications. The Reserve Bank has been emphasising on clarity in regulations and has started including examples, FAQs and illustrations as a part of its regulations for the benefit of the REs. To provide a high-level overview of the regulatory landscape and serve as a broad point of reference for general understanding of the REs, the Reserve Bank had come out with a Handbook titled ‘Regulations at a Glance’ 23 . Further, the Reserve Bank is in the process of consolidating more than 8,000 regulations issued by Department of Regulation, under 30-35 thematic subjects. The regulators need to persist with such initiatives for enhancing the responsiveness of the REs and development of the financial sector. International and domestic regulatory co-operation 42. Given the cross sectoral operations of entities, there is a need for the FSRs to move away from siloed, sector-specific regulations towards cross-functional principle-based regulations. This co-ordination will foster innovation and enable the REs to offer services across different domains as also ensure that they have appropriate risk management protocols. This would also help in capping regulatory arbitrage, while simultaneously reducing compliance requirements for the REs. Additionally, co-operation among regulators across jurisdictions is essential for sharing insights, expertise, and resources to enable more efficient regulation without compromising on quality. 24 International standards serve as a valuable reference point; however, they must be adapted to local contexts and conditions, as a 'one size fits all' approach is neither practical nor effective in today’s diverse regulatory landscape. Consumer centricity 43. We need to consider the impact that regulations can have on one of the most important stakeholders in financial system i.e., consumers. Regulators have remained conscious of the need to empower consumers and safeguard their interests. To advance this objective, they must think beyond conventional approaches. Behavioral economics offers a powerful tool in this regard, providing valuable insights into consumer behavior and decision-making processes. It equips the regulators with an advanced set of policy instruments, most notably, behavioral nudges 25 , which can complement conventional regulatory frameworks by achieving the desired outcomes at far lower compliance costs, thus presenting a more efficient and socially beneficial policy alternative. 26 Conclusion 44. Regulatory policy in the financial sector must strike an optimal balance between the critical need for stability and objectives of fostering innovation, efficiency, and competition. While it is necessary to minimise systemic risks and protect consumers, it should not discourage creativity, innovation, or healthy market dynamics. On the other hand, an overemphasis on innovation and competition - without adequate safeguards - can lead to financial instability, resource misallocation, and ultimately loss of confidence in the system. Finding this right balance is particularly important for India, given the immense size and heterogeneity of economy, growing aspirations, and substantial investment needs to sustain high growth and development. The regulators must consistently strive to achieve this equilibrium. As Mahatma Gandhi said, “You may never know what results come of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no result.” Thank you once again for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you. I wish all participants an enriching and successful deliberations in the programme. 1 Inaugural Address delivered by Shri M Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India – August 18, 2025 - at the DoPT MDP on Financial Market Regulations at the Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode (IIMK).

Rabi Sankar – Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Shri Swaminathan J. – Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Dr. Poonam Gupta – Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Dr. Rajiv Ranjan – Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India Dr. A. R. Joshi – Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India Moderator: Shri Puneet Pancholy – Chief General Manager, Reserve Bank of India Puneet Pancholy: Hello, and good afternoon. Welcome to this Post Monetary Policy Press Conference, third in this financial year 2025-2026. I welcome Governor – Shri Sanjay Malhotra; Deputy Governors, Shri M. Rajeshwar Rao; Shri T. Rabi Sankar; Shri Swaminathan J; and Dr. Poonam Gupta. I also welcome Executive Directors, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan; and Dr. Ajit Joshi, and also, our other colleagues from Reserve Bank. Before we begin, I will request media friends present here to switch off their mobiles or keep them on silent. Further, please restrict to one question per person, it is very important, so that everybody gets a chance to ask. While asking the question, you please switch on the mic in front of you, so that others who are logged on to this or listening to this streaming, they are able to hear. And once you are done, please switch it off. And sir, there are 23 participants from media today, and with your permission, I will start taking the names Sanjay Malhotra: Yes, please. Puneet Pancholy: So, I will request Ms. Latha to ask her question. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Thank you very much for the opportunity, Governor. You have given the growth forecast at 6.5%, retained it and given the forward forecast at 6.6%. How much of the tariff impact have you factored in? Is there a lack of clarity on tariffs and therefore, nothing is factored? And hence, if the tariffs stay or even increase, is there a likelihood that you will be lowering it? I am asking you particularly because that phrase ‘very limited space for monetary easing’ is absent in the entire speech. So, if you lower, will that phrase reappear or will that phrase have no chance of appearing because the year ahead inflation is 4.9%? Sanjay Malhotra: So, first of all, on growth, you are very well aware that we had already reduced our forecast, which was earlier 6.7%, to 6.5%. So, some of the global uncertainties have already been factored in the revised growth forecast. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty as was also mentioned in my statement, and it is really very difficult to predict as to what the impact will be. Going forward, as we have mentioned, we will maintain a very, very close vigil on the incoming data and take a call. As of now, we do not have sufficient data to revise our GDP forecasts. As to your question on the absence of the word or the phrase ‘very limited space’, that was in the context when we moved from accommodative to neutral, we are continuing in neutral. And so, that is why you do not find a mention of that in this statement. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Is it because it (inflation) is 4.9%, that is why you are saying? Why is that phrase absent? Is it because of high inflation or is it because we do not know enough about growth? Sanjay Malhotra: See, we will continue to monitor our macroeconomic conditions on a policy-to-policy basis and accordingly, take a call. It is all very, very uncertain. We already did 100 basis point rate cut. The other thing is that monetary policy transmission is still happening. So, we will continue to do whatever is required to facilitate good growth while, of course, maintaining price stability. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. From the right side, from Doordarshan, Shyama ji will ask the question. Shyama Mishra, Doordarshan: Namaskar, sir. Sir, is RBI worried about the fact that these global changes, trade changes will push up the inflation as the imports will get expensive? Sanjay Malhotra: See, first thing is that in India we are less dependent on the outside, insofar as inflation is concerned. And the other thing is that if at all there is an impact, there is also an impact on the growth, on the demand and that has a reverse impact. We mentioned this, we elaborated this in our monetary policy statement that we made I think a couple of months ago, where we highlighted this aspect that it moves in both directions. As of now we do not see a major impact of this unless we have retaliatory tariffs and so on and so forth, which I really do not foresee. I will request DG Poonam Gupta, would you like to add something? Dr. Poonam Gupta: Sure. In addition to what sir said, let me also remind that our inflation basket, nearly half of it consists of food, which does not get impacted directly by global developments. A significant part consists of non-tradables, which again does not get impacted by global developments. So, to that extent, a first order direct impact of these evolving uncertainties on India’s inflation is likely to be very, very limited. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma’am. I will ask Manojit Saha from Business Standard. Manojit Saha, Business Standard: Thank you, sir. What has stopped the MPC from, given that you have reduced the inflation forecast substantially lower to 3.1%, so what has stopped the MPC from a rate cut? Because you have indicated that you will be forward looking, you will be proactive in interest rate decisions. So, what has actually stopped MPC from a red cut? And also, if you can throw some light on whether the monetary policy is effective on pushing loan growth because loan growth continues to be tepid despite a 100-basis point rate cut? Sanjay Malhotra: See, the reasons for maintaining the policy rate are very, very clearly stated in our resolution, which also found a mention in my statement. Let me reiterate those. One, we did first of all a front-loaded rate cut, 100 basis points over a short period of four months, February to June. Transmission is still happening. Uncertainties still continue. The situation is still evolving. Insofar as inflation is concerned, the projections are more or less, if you discount food which is very volatile. I think I mentioned it somewhere earlier also that while our headline and food inflation over the last 8-9 years since flexible inflation targeting (FIT) was introduced has been at 4.9%. The volatility in food prices is of the region of 3% on an average. The deviation, the absolute deviation is 3%, 5.9 plus minus 3% is the average. Whereas that in core is much less, about 1.1% in absolute terms. So, the changes that have happened are primarily because of food, and not core inflation. Core inflation, in fact, has only gone up slightly from the previous months. So, these are the reasons that we have continued to maintain the policy rate. We will keep watching incoming data and evolving outlook of our macroeconomic conditions and the MPC will accordingly take a view on the policy from meeting-to-meeting. Insofar as the impact of rates is concerned, I have given figures in the statement. It is about 71 basis points on the credit side. Bank credit rates until June within a period of four months, of which about 55 basis points of total 71 basis points is because of the change in the rate and not because of the change in the mix of the credit loans. So, that has happened. And obviously, that will certainly help not only growth in credit, but also, it will impact the real economy. As you are all aware, it happens with a lag this time while the rates have of course come down significantly faster. The impact on the real economy will also start to happen. So, there is no reason to believe that this will not have a growth inducing impact. Manojit Saha, Business Standard: Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Mayur Shetty from the Times of India. Mayur Shetty, The Times of India: Thank you, sir. This morning you explained the credit, the slowdown in credit demand, you said that there is some shift to other financial instruments. But the sectoral figures show that even housing, which typically goes up when rates go down, has slowed down. What do you think is the reason for this? Sanjay Malhotra: I think, first of all, it is important to look at data at a regular basis, at a micro basis, at a month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter basis. But to extract signals out of that, I think we should be hesitant in extracting signals out of that data. So, it is the long-term data that is more relevant to make any insights out of it. And on the other hand, I would also like to point out, these fluctuations will be there. There will be noise, as you are aware. So, we have to remove that noise. How do you remove that noise, becomes very difficult if you are actually looking at data on a month-to-month, day-to-day basis. Having said that, housing credit, I think overall, it is doing well, it is doing very well. It may have moderated somewhat, but these are to be expected. There will be some ups and downs. I think overall housing credit is 14% as we speak, which is very good, which is more than our average credit growth rate of about 10% that we are having this year. And some of the impact, as I mentioned, happens with a lag, we have reduced the rate. So, while the reduction in the rates has happened, its’ translation into credit growth rate, people take their time to... It is a long-term investment. Housing is not a short-term investment. If you go to the market, you buy a consumer durable, it is not like that. It is a long-term investment. So, that also has an impact over here. Mayur Shetty, The Times of India: Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now, I will request Ekta Suri from Zee Business to ask the question. Ekta Suri, Zee Business: Good afternoon, sir. Sir, first of all congratulations, sir. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has thanked RBI a lot for setting up camps for financial inclusion in the Gram Panchayats. Sir, my question is that if we look at the results of banks this time, we see an increase in NPAs and if we talk about the MFI segment, you had raised concern last time too that NPAs are increasing in it. Can we see any kind of rules and regulations getting stricter regarding that? Especially when the NBFCs raise money in the priority sector but their rates have increased like money lenders. So, can we see the rules getting stricter to reduce that? And secondly, if we talk about MuleHunter, many banks have implemented it, so how quickly can common people get their money back, the money lost due to fraud? And how safe is their money now? Thank you, sir. Sanjay Malhotra: You Ekta, have asked a lot of questions at once. First of all, thank you for congratulating us on financial inclusion. It is very important for us and we have mentioned it in our monetary policy statement as well. So, we would like you to convey our efforts to all our listeners and viewers, and publicise it so that people can benefit from it. You mentioned that some NPAs have increased, I do not have such information. I have mentioned it in our monetary policy statement as well, that in total our net NPAs, our gross NPAs, when we look at the entire banking sector, 2.2% gross, it is from 0.5% to 0.6% net NPAs, so it is quite satisfactory, and it has not increased. It is possible that in some sectors, as you mentioned in MFI, in unsecured loans, there are some NPAs that have increased, due to which we have increased the credit (risk) weights. We had also seen that the increase in the credit rates in MFI and unsecured personal loans, which then decreased. So, in general, there is nothing to worry about for us, and we are always trying. Especially in the bottom of the pyramid, microfinance people are taking loans up to ₹10,000, ₹5,000, ₹50,000, and that is a very important and important part of our entire stakeholders. Approximately 8 crore people, MFIs, although the amount is only ₹3,75,000 crore, approximately ₹4,00,000 crore, we have an overall credit of ₹180,00,000 crores. It accounts for only 2% of that amount, but there are approximately 8 crore people, because our total loan accounts are 8 crore. It may be fewer in terms of number of people, because sometimes a person takes up to two loans. So, this is a very important and important part for us, and whatever we have to do for them, to have more financial inclusion, like we are setting up camps, we will continue to work on that. Third your question is on MuleHunter, first of all, I would like to say that last year, the financial frauds that we saw, if you look at the total amount, then it was about the same as it was in 2023-2024. It has not increased much. So, if you look at every transaction, there has been a reduction in it. So, this is a matter of satisfaction for us. Secondly, our MuleHunter programme is moving ahead, now 15 banks have joined us in this, and we will definitely benefit from it in this direction. Ekta Suri, Zee Business: Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you very much, sir. Now, I will ask Vishwanath Nair from NDTV Profit to ask his question. Vishwanath Nair, NDTV Profit: Thank you, Puneet sir. Governor, the conversation of the so-called uncertainty after the tariff policy measures that have been announced from the US, they are still continuing. The President there consistently makes statements about specific tariffs to India. A lot of economists have pointed out that monetary policy may not be the appropriate tool to support Indian businesses in such a scenario. Is there anything that the RBI can do or is prepared to do on top of, say, cutting rates? Sanjay Malhotra: See, we have taken a number of measures to support growth. It is not only on the monetary policy, liquidity side, even on the prudential regulation side, we have taken measures. Even on the FEMA side, I think we have a draft now, which will be put up, so as to ease doing businesses, to ease doing international trade. And we will continue to do whatever is required to be done in such a scenario. Of course, trade negotiations are still continuing. We are hopeful that we will have an amicable solution. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we have Hamsini from Money Control. Hamsini Karthik, Moneycontrol: Hi. Governor, when we speak to banks, one of the largest fears that they have is with respect to growth. And they are also seeing a large part of their deposits moving out into equity and equity-related products. Rather, corporatisation of deposits, as bankers call it, is a trend that they are increasingly seeing. In this context, how much room do you further envisage for transmission of rates? Because we have already seen a healthy transmission as far as lending is concerned, numbers are in the ballpark of 71 (bps). On the lending side and on deposits, it is 87 (bps). We have had 100 bps cut from February. Do you see further room for rates happening for banks, considering that their balance sheets will also remain healthy? Should they transmit more money? Or should we look out for a longer pause in rate action, which of the two is more likely to play out? Sanjay Malhotra: I think, I answered your question earlier. We will continue to look at the incoming data. And the Monetary Policy Committee meets every two months, we will consider all possible scenarios. And basis that we will take a decision. It will not be right on my part to pre-empt. Not only pre-empt, I really do not have, as of now, any answers. We will see. Whatever was to be done today has been done. So, let us wait for another two months and see how the economy actually shapes up, how the monetary policy transmission is actually happening, how the real economy is responding to all these things. And then, we will again take up, as we have mentioned, we will not be found wanting in whatever is required, to provide the right balance of price stability and economic growth for the development of our country. Hamsini Karthik, Moneycontrol: Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now, I will ask Mr. Ashish Agashe from PTI. Ashish Agashe, PTI: Thank you so much, sir. Sir, with your statement today and especially by making the point that food inflation is very volatile and your projections also, are you probably preparing for a longer pause on the rates front from here on? Sanjay Malhotra: Same question asked in a different way. So, I do not have anything more to add, sorry. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next we will have Mr. Anup Roy from Bloomberg. Anup Roy, Bloomberg: Sir, if India has to stop buying Russian oil or has to revert back to that 1% of the total oil purchase that we had with Russia, what could be the impact on inflation? Has the RBI done any study or do you have any assessment on that? Sanjay Malhotra: See, how the inflation will pan out, I think some of it, DG also mentioned. Of course, crude is an important element in determining our inflation. But at the same time, let us keep two things in mind. It is not only Russian oil. Oil earlier, you know, I mean, it is not only Russian oil that we are taking. We are taking oil from many other countries. If the mix changes, what is its impact on prices? What is the global commodity prices of crude? It will depend on all that. And the other thing it will depend on is how much of its impact downwards or upwards, is actually you know, taken by the government in the form of excise duties and other tariffs. So, we do not see any major impact as of now because of this on inflation because I think the government over there will take an appropriate decision on the fiscal side in case there is any shock over there. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Anurag Shah from ET Now Swadesh. Anurag Shah, ET Now Swadesh: Namaste sir. Sir you have announced three consumer centric policies today and crores of Jan-Dhan accounts re-KYC will be done through those three policies. They will be offered the insurance and pension products also. I wanted to understand that the Mule accounts have become a big problem in which you have said that there has been a reduction in the number of transactions. But now, another big issue has been exposed by the UP police. It was also done last month on a very large scale. These accounts, there are many big banks as well and some people have died a few months ago but through these big banks, their KYCs are being done. Their accounts are being opened. Transactions are taking place and this is going on a large scale. So, in view of that, this re-KYC will be done on a large scale. And, sir, you said in the same context that need analysis is very important for the products that are sold through banks. So, sir, will there be a framework for need analysis and how will the need analysis be done? Sanjay Malhotra: You have certainly raised very important questions and for this, the Reserve Bank, the banks are always vigilant. Whether you spoke about the Mule account. You said about the re-KYC. And you said about mis-selling. So, we have taken many steps for this. We are already running a project for the Mule account. We will implement it soon. We will get help from it, as I said earlier. And for mis-selling, we have warned our banks and regulated entities many times. And there is definitely room for improvement in this. I will not say that there is no room for improvement. But there has already been a lot of improvement in this and we will take more steps in this and try to improve it further. Anurag Shah, ET Now Swadesh: Sir, there is credit-linked insurance. If we look around the world, there are regulators. There is no credit-linked insurance anywhere. Only in India, credit link insurance is encouraged more. Sanjay Malhotra: No, according to me, it is not like that. Only in India. You are probably saying bancassurance. You are probably saying that banks sell insurance products only in India. This is not right. There are many other countries where banks are selling insurance products. Other products are also being sold. And the benefit of this is that a network that we have already made earlier. If more than one product is sold through the same network, then the costs are reduced and economies of scale improve. And financial inclusion is also aided, especially in rural areas. So, keeping that in mind, we have allowed this here. And there are many other countries where this is allowed. Our effort should be that there should be no mis-selling. There should be need analysis, as you said. And the products should be sold to the right people. So, our focus should not be on totally banning it or shutting it down. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next will be Sangita Mehta from The Economic Times. Sangita Mehta, The Economic Times: Thank you, sir. Sir, you have spoken about transmission on the deposit side, almost 87 basis points and it is still unfolding. What I wanted to understand from you is that share of deposits in financial savings is likely to fall if interest rates come down. So, in that sense, there is also the perception that people would move to riskier assets, savings would move to high-yielding assets like mutual funds. So, are you seeing this affecting, impacting banks' deposit growth and also banks' ability to fund corporates? Sanjay Malhotra: So let me take your second question first. The ability of the banks to fund corporates, I do not think that is getting in any way impeded because of this. The banks have sufficient funds in order to meet the needs of the economy, be it corporates, be it households, be it the government sector. So that is certainly not impeded. Yes, to your first question as to whether there is a shift, there is certainly a shift from banking to equity, from debt to equity. I think that is on the whole it is a healthy trend for any economy. As it grows, there should be a good mix and I think we are moving towards that. We should not be unduly concerned about that. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, I will have Aryan from Informist Media. Aaryan Khanna, Informist Media: Sir, thank you so much for the question. First, just a clarification, do the FY2026-27 CPI estimates take into account any changes in the weightage of the CPI basket which is expected in February next year? Sanjay Malhotra: No. Aaryan Khanna, Informist Media: Okay, so then coming to the question. Inflation projections seem to show that the current food inflation trajectory will not last in the sense that core inflation will overpower it in the coming quarters. Can the continued good monsoon and supply side measures not keep CPI nearer the target of around 4% in the next year as well? Sanjay Malhotra: See, we have given our projections, but when we give this projection, there are risks on both sides. So, can it not be downwards? Of course, it can be downwards, it can be upwards. That is the short answer to your question. These are projections, these are very difficult things to do. We had projected earlier and not only we, some of the professional forecasters too, you are aware, we had all projected a 3.7%, I mean we had projected 3.7%. They had in fact projected a 3.8% average growth inflation rate for this year and we have all been surprised this time. So, these are projections, these are difficult things to do. I would certainly not venture to say that it cannot be lower than this. Aaryan Khanna, Informist Media: So, just to follow up on this, would you then give greater primacy to core CPI, going ahead considering the minutes of the last meeting also mentioned it and you have also mentioned it in your statement? Sanjay Malhotra: Both are important, core as well as headline, both are important. What weightage is to be given at what point of time and the outlook, again that is something which the MPC looks at it from meeting to meeting and I did say and we are on record to say this, that there is higher volatility in food prices, they can be transient and so you have to see these things and sometimes look through if you feel that some of the inflation is because of transient reasons. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, I will have Swati Bhat from Reuters. Swati Bhat, Reuters: Thank you, sir. Sir, just sticking to the trade talks, it seems like on the face of it, the diplomatic relations between India and the US have also soured to some extent. You would be more privy to what is happening there. But I just wanted to understand, would it impact the foreign portfolio inflows and foreign investments into India because of the way things stand? And subsequently, what would the impact on the rupee be? Are you concerned and looking at it internally at RBI? Thank you. Sanjay Malhotra: See, foreign flows - inflows, outflows will depend on so many things, both current account and capital account, It is very early, actually to say but as I mentioned earlier, we are quite confident that our reserves are, we are having 11 months of merchandise imports, reserves. And so, we are very confident of meeting whatever needs are there from the external sector. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Ankur from ET Now. Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Thank you, Puneet ji, for giving a chance. Good afternoon, Governor. You have kept intact the projections for FY 2025-26 at 6.5% as far as GDP is concerned. In your statement, at point number 10, you have mentioned that growth remains robust in line with your projections, but below your aspirations. What is the aspiration you would want to have first? And another thing, last time when we had interactions, you did give assurance on one particular bank name. And whereby now the MD and CEO is also appointed, I want to understand from you, now any kind of remedial action is still remaining from the bank side. Because on SEBI front, yes, final order is still remaining, but is RBI also looking into it and the responses which has been given or the action which has been taken by the bank is sufficient? Sanjay Malhotra: See, we do not take specific entity-related, bank-related questions, so I will avoid that. But your first question related to what is the aspirational growth rate, it is certainly more than 6.5%, and in the past, we have done, I think 7.8% on an average. We have done that. So certainly, we should aspire for higher growth rates than 6.5%. Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Lalatendu Mishra from The Hindu. Lalatendu Mishra, The Hindu: Good afternoon, Governor. US President Donald Trump has said that Indian economy is dead. What is your reaction to that, sir? Sanjay Malhotra: No, no, I am not the right person to react to the President, but, yes, I mean, you are all aware we have a very robust growth rate, 6.5%, and in fact as per IMF, 6.4% and 3% growth rate of the world when they look at that, we are contributing about 18%, which is more than US, where the contribution is expected to be much less, at about, I think, 11% or something. So, we are doing very well, and we will continue to further improve. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. From the right-hand side here, Mr. Mahesh Nayak from FE. Mahesh Nayak, Financial Express: Good afternoon, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. Just wanted to know, is today India ready to bite the bullet on capital convertibility, full capital convertibility? Would want your view on that, because having a very strong economy, do you think we can forego a temporary pain and look into fully capital convertibility? Sanjay Malhotra: There is no proposal for any changes as of now. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Ms. Gopika from the Mint. Gopika Gopakumar, Mint: Good afternoon, Governor. This was regarding the currency depreciation we have seen over the last one month. Dollar-rupee has risen by around 2.8%. Is that limiting RBI's ability to cut rates? And secondly, taking Ankur's question forward, in similar circumstance, we have seen RBI suspending the board, taking over, appointing RBI nominee directors on the boards of such banks, where there is a fraud or instances of fraud which has happened. Is RBI planning to take any action against the promoter or the board in this particular case, considering RBI has also allowed the promoter to increase the stake and also appoint two nominee directors on the board? Sanjay Malhotra: See, we do not take, as I mentioned earlier, we do not take any entity-specific questions, so I will skip that. Rupee depreciation, again there will be some volatility. We are living in very uncertain times, as you are aware. And so, some of the volatility is expected. The volatility is there not only in our currency, but even in currencies of other countries, including the US. The US currency has seen depreciation and then depreciation, both side movement of about 10%. So, in that context, our movement is much less. How does it impact our monetary policy? As I said, it is a mix of so many things. But more so, the domestic growth and inflation dynamics. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. From the same side, Mr. Piyush from the Hindu Business Line. Piyush Shukla, The Hindu Business Line: Good afternoon, Governor, DGs, sir. Thanks, Puneet ji. Sir, upper-layer NBFCs are supposed to get listed by next month. Tata Sons has filed for a deregistration of their NBFC-CIC license. What is the update on that? Will you give them an extension or will you approve their request, one? Second, Rabi Sankar sir, some of the banks have actually started applying charges on UPI to payment aggregators and merchants of some categories. Governor Sir, in his earlier public remarks, mentioned that UPI can't be free forever. So, from a regulatory perspective, do you allow banks to… because this is no MDR, so they are somehow wanting to monetise this particular thing. Any views in this regard? Thank you. Sanjay Malhotra: Let me come in first, and then I will pass the floor to DG Rabi Sankar. You are aware, entity-specific questions we avoid, right? But, saying that I said that it (UPI) cannot remain free forever, I never said that. I am sorry. I want to clarify; I never said that it can remain free forever. The question was, I think, to the effect that whether do you see that the MDR, etc., will be charged on consumers. And I said over there that there are costs. What is important, I said, is that there are costs, and these costs have to be paid by someone. Who pays is important but not so important than someone footing the bill. And so, it is important for us, for the sustainability, that whether collectively or individually, someone pays for it. So, I never said that it cannot remain free forever. My sense is that it is not free even now. Someone is paying for it. The government is subsidising it. But somewhere the costs are being paid. The question really is who pays for it. That is the other question. But I never said that the users will have to pay. I did mention that the government policy has actually helped in expanding the use of UPI and I gave some numbers - 31 crore per day to 61 crore per day UPI transactions over the last two months. So I will leave it at that, and then I will request DG Rabi Sankar, if you have to add anything. T. Rabi Sankar: Nothing else. I think that answers this question. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sirs. Next, I will request Mr. Hitesh from Indian Express. Hitesh Vyas, Indian Express: Sir, in the monetary policy report, you have made some assumption with crude oil at USD 70 per barrel and rupee at 86 (per USD). Is there any need to change it in the current situation? Sanjay Malhotra: We just did this modelling. We have just taken these assumptions. As of now, obviously, there is no need to change it. Going forward, what happens, it is evolving. Things evolve. Earlier, we had taken some other numbers. And as data comes in, I am not saying that these are sacrosanct, and I will stick to these. No. I will not be so presumptuous to say that. But as of now, yes, these are the best estimates that we have. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you so very much, sir. Lastly, we will have Ben from The New Indian Express. Ben Kochuveedan, The New Indian Express: Hi, sir. You have mentioned the volatility in the food prices many a time during the conference also. There is some talk about or there is some call by some economists for taking out the food basket from retail inflation. What is the RBI's and the MPC's view on that? Is there any talk within MPC or RBI? Sanjay Malhotra: Our target is certainly the headline inflation. And the FIT is due for a review. Every 5 years, we do it. There is a discussion paper which we are preparing and which we will open to public consultation. And after that, the final view has to be taken by the government. We will give our views to the government as to how we should move ahead in this regard. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18 The consultation will be private or it will be for the public also, right? Sanjay Malhotra: Yes. It will be for the public also. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. With this, we come to the close of this press conference. I thank the top management of Reserve Bank for answering all the questions. And I thank you all for making it very interactive. Have a nice afternoon and good day. Sanjay Malhotra: Thank you very much.",

      "summary": "The Karur Vysya Bank family - represented here by the Chairperson, the Directors on the Board, the shareholders, MD CEO, the staff, officials and the customers of the bank and their families, ladies and gentlemen, Anaivarukkum Vanakkam. Namaskaram. A warm good afternoon. 2. It is both an honour and a privilege to join you here in Karur on the momentous occasion of KVB’s 109th Foundation Day. I extend my sincere gratitude to Shri Ramesh Babu, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer for his kind invitation. 3. Karur is a town where history, commerce, and character are deeply intertwined. It is a place celebrated in Sangam literature as ‘ Karuvoor’ or ‘Vanji ’—a thriving hub of poetry, trade, and craftsmanship, that served as the capital city of early Chera kings. That spirit of enterprise and cultural pride lives on through institutions like KVB. Founding with Foresight 1 4. Today is not just a ceremonial gathering to mark the passage of time. It is a celebration of vision, resolve, and quiet determination—a tribute to those who chose to build a lasting institution in the face of uncertainty. 5. In 1916, as the First World War caused disruptions and hardship, two visionaries from Karur, Shri M.A. Venkatarama Chettiar and Shri Athi Krishna Chettiar, came together to create a bank rooted in trust and community service. 6. The founders travelled across the region, sometimes fording the Amaravati River in a coracle, appealing to landholders and traders and offering their personal guarantees to reassure hesitant investors. Memories of financial failures like the Arbuthnot crash 2 were still fresh, and public trust in banking was fragile. Yet, the founders’ integrity and persistence won the day. KVB was formally registered on June 22, 1916, with a paid-up capital of ₹1.20 lakh, exceeding their original target. Fittingly, the first shareholder was Goddess Gayathri Devi, who continues to bestow her blessings on the bank and its clientele. 7. The bank’s founding team embedded forward-looking principles in its structure: they voluntarily incorporated a clause prohibiting directors from taking loans from the bank—a safeguard that only became a statutory requirement decades later with the Banking Regulation Act of 1949. They also envisaged employee participation in the bank’s future by allotting shares to staff—long before the idea of stock options became fashionable. Each manager was to hold 50 shares, officers 20 shares, and cashiers, reflecting their key role, were to be allotted 40 shares. 8. What they began with prudence and purpose has today grown into a ₹1.86 lakh crore institution, standing as a testament to their values, vision, and unshakeable trust in community enterprise. Banking for Viksit Bharat: Adapting with Purpose and Agility 9. The 109th year of KVB comes at a time of profound change in India’s economy and the broader financial system. As the nation moves towards the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047, banks are being called upon not only to expand credit, but also to play a deeper role—supporting inclusive growth, maintaining financial stability, and driving responsible innovation. 10. I am sure KVB has already taken meaningful steps in this direction. But the journey ahead will demand even greater agility, foresight, and commitment to purpose. 11. In thinking about how banks like KVB can navigate the path ahead, I am reminded of a verse from the Thirukkural, which is a treasure trove of timeless guidance for thoughtful action: “பொருள் கருவி காலம் வினை-யிடனொடு ஐந்தும் இருள்தீர எண்ணிச் செயல்” (Poruḷ karuvi kāalam viṉai-yiṭaṉodu aindhum iruḷtheera eṇṇi cheyal) Literal meaning 3 : “Do an act after a due consideration of the {following} five, viz., Money, means, time, execution and place .” 12. What the sage Thiruvalluvar tells us is this: “The wise act only after reflecting on five things—resources, tools, timing, action, and place or context—to dispel any uncertainty and act with clarity.” 13. To my mind, this is not just classical wisdom—it is a practical framework, deeply relevant to modern banking. These five elements have shaped KVB’s journey so far, and they will be critical in shaping its future. So let us reflect on each of these—not as philosophy, but as building blocks for a strong, agile, and responsible banking institution. Porul (Money/Resources): Using Strength with Discipline 14. In banking, resources are more than just financial capital. They include people, systems, institutional memory, customer trust, and reputation. Sound resource management is all about the quality of decisions and the sustainability of outcomes. 15. It is not enough to meet regulatory thresholds or improve headline numbers. What matters is how these financial resources are deployed—whether they support inclusive lending, long-term investment, or business models that promote trust and transparency. Every rupee must carry intent, not just interest. 16. Equally important are the less tangible, but no less critical, resources that do not reside on the balance sheet. These include the people who engage with customers every day, the internal controls that drive decisions and manage risk, and the institutional values that shape internal culture. 17. A bank’s reputation, once established, becomes one of its most valuable assets. In an environment of rising competition and evolving customer expectations, the way forward lies in building upon a customer-centric approach that fosters trust, loyalty, and long-term value. Karuvi (Tools/Means): Staying Ahead with Responsible Innovation 18. The tools of banking have evolved rapidly—from passbooks and ledgers to core banking platforms, mobile apps, real-time payment systems and artificial intelligence. 19. These tools define how services are delivered, how decisions are made, and increasingly, how risks are managed. In this environment, a bank’s technological capabilities are no longer just operational enablers; they have become strategic differentiators. 20. However, every tool comes with responsibility. The speed and scale of digital adoption must be matched by equally strong investments in cybersecurity, data governance, and ethical safeguards. Recent global and domestic experiences have shown that technology gaps, if not addressed in time, can become points of systemic vulnerability. 21. For banks looking to scale up responsibly, tools must be modern, agile, and continuously evolving. More importantly, they must be well-governed. Technology must never outrun the organisation’s capacity to manage it. Directors and senior management must lead this conversation, ensuring that risk, compliance, and internal audit functions have the resources and visibility needed to keep pace. Kaalam (Time/Timing): Knowing When to Act 22. In banking, timing can be the difference between a breakthrough and missed opportunity, between resilience and regret. Whether it is extending credit, entering new markets, or rebalancing portfolios, the ability to act at the right moment, and with the right judgment, is essential. 23. Timing also requires contextual awareness. Economic cycles, interest rate shifts, regulatory changes, geopolitical developments, and even climate events—all influence when and how decisions should be made. A delay in recognising an early stress, or a rushed response to market signals, can have lasting consequences. 24. But timing is not only about reacting to external events. It is also about recognising when an institution needs to change internally—when to modernise systems, when to refresh leadership, when to pause and consolidate, and when to take bold steps forward. History rewards institutions that act early, rather than those that act perfectly. 25. The founders of KVB acted at such a moment. Their decision to establish a bank in 1916, in the midst of war and economic uncertainty, was bold, timely, and rooted in the needs of the community. The same sense of timing and responsiveness must now guide the bank as it enters its next phase. Vinai (Action/Execution): Converting Thought into Execution – From the Boardroom to the Branch 26. Strategy has little meaning, unless it is translated into action. For a bank, this means ensuring that intent at the top is reflected in outcomes on the ground. Policies made in the boardroom must find meaningful expression at the branch. The strongest frameworks—whether related to risk, credit, technology, or compliance—are only as effective as their execution at the customer interface. 27. Effective action requires clarity, coordination, and accountability. Whether it is launching a new product, entering a new geography, or rolling out a compliance reform, success depends on how well goals are communicated, how clearly roles are defined, and how outcomes are tracked. 28. However, driven by intense competitive pressures and a desire to project short-term success, the management of certain banks and NBFCs appears to believe that the ends justify the means. Practices such as creative accounting, liberal interpretations of regulations, lenient policy frameworks, and inadequate internal controls are being normalised in some boardrooms—necessitating supervisory intervention. Though such instances may be limited, they risk eroding the public’s trust in the integrity of the banking system. 29. Therefore, it is important to pursue growth with systems, people, and processes that are aligned and rooted in ethical practices—from the boardroom to the branch. Idan / Idam (Context/Place): Understanding the Terrain 30. Every institution operates within a broader environment—economic, social, technological, and geographic. The most resilient banks are those that remain deeply aware of their context and continually adapt to it. 31. KVB has long drawn strength from its community roots. Its orientation towards semi-urban and rural markets, and its close connection to the needs of local businesses and households, has shaped its identity and customer relationships. 32. However, context is never static. Changing demographics, climate variability, digital access, migration patterns, and sectoral shifts are constantly reshaping the operating environment. As India progresses towards the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047, banks will be called upon to adapt continuously—to serve a more aspirational, mobile, and digitally connected population. 33. Geographic concentration can bring familiarity, but it also introduces exposure. Regional slowdowns and policy changes can affect concentrated portfolios more acutely. Banks must continuously assess whether their branch network, sectoral mix, and credit exposure are aligned with the emerging realities around them. 34. Expanding into new markets or product segments brings promise, but this also calls for capacity-building—in terms of people, processes, and local knowledge. 35. The most effective banks are those that understand not only their own strengths, but also the terrain in which they operate. For a bank with a rich heritage and legacy like KVB, the ability to balance deep local insight with broader diversification will be key to navigating the next phase of growth. In this dynamic environment, staying true to its community roots while embracing innovation and adaptability is what will truly define the “smart way to bank” 4 . Conclusion: Closing Thoughts for the Road Ahead 36. Let me return, in closing, to the words from Thirukkural that guided my reflections today. It reminds us that lasting success is built not on chance or scale, but on careful thought and considered action. Resources must be used with discipline. Tools must be modern and well-governed. Timing must be informed by awareness. Action must translate intent into outcome. And context must guide judgment at every step. 37. In my address today, I have tried to compress my 37 years of experience—as a banker and, more recently, as a banking supervisor—into the timeless framework provided by the sagacious Thiruvalluvar. His words speak not just to individual wisdom, but to institutional purpose. 38. In the 109 years since its founding, KVB has honoured these principles in many ways—quietly, steadily, and purposefully. But the road ahead will be more complex, more competitive, and more demanding. The institutions that will lead in this environment are not those that move the fastest, but those that move with clarity, with courage, and with conviction. 39. From the Reserve Bank’s perspective, we expect banks like KVB to continue evolving—setting benchmarks in governance and customer service, empowering its assurance functions, and using technology not just for efficiency, but for inclusion. Every Bank Board and management has a responsibility to deepen the hard-earned trust—through service that is responsive, systems that are reliable, and leadership that is responsible. 40. My warmest congratulations to the entire KVB family—past and present—on this remarkable milestone. May the future be built on innovation with prudence, growth with responsibility, and leadership with integrity. 41. Nandri. Thank you and best wishes.

Arbuthnot & Co., a leading British firm in Madras, collapsed due to speculative mismanagement, triggering widespread panic. Thousands of depositors, including pensioners and officials, even the Governor of Madras, lost their savings. The episode severely eroded trust in foreign-run banks and inspired the founding of Indian Bank in 1907. 3 Thirukural 675: English Translation and Commentary by Rev. Dr. G. U. Pope, Rev W. H.

      "summary": "Principal, NIBM, Dr Partha Ray, Members of Faculty, my colleagues from the Reserve Bank of India, and most importantly, our promising future bankers from the PGDM Batch of 2025-27. A very good evening to all of you. 2. It is a privilege to be here at the National Institute of Bank Management—an institution that stands as a pillar of excellence in banking education, research, and leadership development ever since its founding by the Reserve Bank of India in 1969. NIBM has indeed contributed immensely to building intellectual capacity and strategic vision in the sector. This beautiful campus in Pune is not just picturesque—it is a crucible where ideas are forged, careers are shaped, and the future of Indian banking is quietly nurtured. 3. I would like to thank Dr. Ray and the entire faculty for inviting me to be part of this significant milestone in your journey—the beginning of a two-year programme that, I am confident, will challenge you, shape you, and prepare you for the responsibilities ahead. Reflections from the Journey 4. Over the course of my career, I have been fortunate to experience the best of two remarkable institutions—the scale and grassroots connect of the State Bank of India, and the intellectual depth and policy perspective of the Reserve Bank of India. Along the way, I have gathered a few lessons—some from success, and many more from challenges—that I believe may resonate with you, especially as you embark on your journey into the world of banking and finance. 5. You will soon dive deep into subjects like Banking Law and Practice. One of the things you will notice is that banking, unlike many other industries, does not operate solely on the strength of laws and regulations. A significant part of what holds the system together are the conventions and practices established by bankers themselves—what we refer to as Banking Practice. 6. For instance, consider something as familiar as crossing a cheque with “Account Payee”. There is no specific statute mandating it—but it is a time-honoured convention that enhances safety and limits misuse. These practices, developed over time through experience and prudence, carry the weight of law in many contexts. They represent the professionalism, caution, and trust that underpin banking at its best. 7. And so, while your curriculum will cover frameworks, policies, and tools, what will truly shape you as a banker is your ability to blend knowledge with judgment, law with convention, and theory with practice. 8. It is in that spirit that I would like to share four simple reflections—each in the form of a metaphor or analogy—which I hope will serve you well as you begin your own journey. These are: The Lemon, The Lookout, The Deer, and The King. The Lemon 9. You’ve all heard the phrase: “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” I’d like to take it a step further: “Life will give you lemons—so be prepared to make lemonade, lemon pickle, lemon cake… whatever the situation calls for.” 10. Let me tell you about one of my own “lemons”. After completing my two years of probation at SBI, I had hoped to be posted in Bangalore—a city where I had trained. Instead, I found myself in Hubli, some 400 kms north of Bangalore, assigned to the Data Processing Centre of the Bank as a Programmer—a role I had no background of. Computers in the banks were still in their infancy. It was a complete surprise. 11. When I reported, the Personnel Officer told me something profound: “We don’t need computer experts who can learn banking—we need bankers who can learn computers.” That perspective changed everything. 12. It was tough. I had to learn from scratch. But with inputs from institutional training, support from colleagues and a willingness to adapt, I was soon contributing to transforming how the Bank collected and processed its data for feeding into regulatory reporting and executive decision-making systems. 13. The broader point is this: life—and your career—will not go exactly as planned. You may not get the role or the location you desire. But the ability to adapt, to embrace the unfamiliar, and to turn unexpected situations into learning experiences is what will set you apart. 14. So, yes—life will hand you lemons. Don’t just make lemonade. Learn to enjoy the process of learning how. The Lookout 15. On a ship, lookouts are stationed to watch for obstacles, changing weather, and other vessels—long before the captain or crew becomes aware of them. Their job is simple but vital: spot trouble early and alert the team in time to act. 16. One of the most well-known examples is the sinking of the Titanic. Despite its size, sophistication, and engineering, the Titanic struck an iceberg it couldn’t avoid—not because no one saw it, but because it wasn’t seen in time. The ship was moving too fast, and there wasn’t enough time or flexibility to change course. 17. The lesson is clear. In banking—as in life—it is not always the biggest or most advanced systems that succeed. It is the ones that stay alert, that course-correct early, and that respect the value of foresight. 18. As future bankers, you must develop the mindset of a lookout. Banking today is more complex than ever. While digital transformation has brought speed and convenience, it has also created new vulnerabilities—cyber threats, phishing, synthetic identities, deepfakes, and third-party risks. 19. As transactions become real-time and frictionless, the time it takes for damage to occur—and spread—has drastically shortened. Vigilance is no longer optional; it is an essential and core professional skill. 20. Yes, banks need strong systems and protocols. But they also need alert professionals who scan the environment, anticipate risks, and speak up early. You must be that lookout—always asking: What is on the horizon? What could go wrong? What needs attention before it's too late? 21. Innovation and speed are vital. But so are situational awareness, caution, judgment, and the courage to act. Be the one who notices the iceberg early—not the one explaining the damage afterward. The Deer 22. Let us talk about agility—and endurance. Have you ever wondered how a deer sometimes escapes a cheetah—the fastest land animal on the planet? In fact, a cheetah’s hunting success rate is only around 50 per cent 1 . 23. It is not because the deer runs faster. It is because it is more agile. While the cheetah is built for speed, the deer survives by turning sharply, changing direction unpredictably, and using its surroundings wisely. This ability to adapt quickly—to change course in the face of danger—is often what saves it. 24. But there is another crucial factor: endurance. Cheetahs are sprinters, not marathoners. They can maintain top speed only for about 20 to 30 seconds before their bodies begin to overheat. If the prey can hold out just a few seconds longer—keep zig-zagging, stay hidden, or reach denser terrain—the cheetah must slow down or stop. Many hunts fail not because the cheetah is not fast enough, but because it cannot sustain the chase. 25. And each failed sprint comes at a cost. It consumes enormous energy and leaves the cheetah physically drained, needing time to recover. Too many failed chases can lead to exhaustion—and even make the cheetah vulnerable 26. This, to me, is a profound lesson for all of us—especially those entering a dynamic, highly demanding profession like banking. It is not enough to be fast. You must be agile. But equally, you must know how to pace yourself. 27. A good banker isn’t just quick to act—but also able to endure uncertainty, recover from setbacks, and stay focused over the long run. You will face moments of rapid change—crises, deadlines, audits, policy shifts—but you will also need the discipline and stamina to navigate slow, complex processes that unfold over months or years. 28. Agility helps you dodge what’s in front of you. Endurance helps you stay the course. You will need both. The King 29. Finally, let me speak about what I believe is the most important aspect of banking: the customer—the King . I have deliberately saved this for the end, because even if you forget everything else I have said today, I hope you will remember this. 30. \"Customer is the King\" is a phrase we hear often. It is printed on posters, included in mission statements, and used in marketing campaigns. But in banking, it is not just a slogan— it is our duty. 31. The number of customer complaints—especially through digital channels—has risen significantly in recent years. From social engineering frauds to poor grievance redressal, the loss and frustration is real. Often, the problem is not the product or service—but, as I see it, the real issue is a lack of empathy . 32. We see increasing automation but decreasing ownership . Systems respond with templated emails; helplines loop back endlessly. This is not how trust is built, and certainly not how it can be sustained. 33. When I was a young Field Officer in SBI, we took pride in truly knowing our customers. Nowadays, KYC is often reduced to a periodic ritual. Today’s banker must find a way to bring back that personal awareness and responsibility —even in a digital context. 34. A senior citizen struggling with an ATM pin… A borrower in a rural area unsure how to repay digitally… A small business owner worried about a UPI refund… 35. They are not just service requests. They are moments of trust. They all deserve your time, your patience, and your professionalism . 36. Technology will enable the transaction. But only you can build the relationship and only you can earn the customer’s trust for your institution. Finally, that is what will distinguish a banker from an app. Closing Reflections 37. Over the next two years, you will be immersed in the principles and practices of modern banking—credit, risk, compliance, technology, analytics, and more. NIBM will equip you with the tools. But how you use them —with empathy, curiosity, and integrity—is what will define your journey. 38. You are entering a profession that is not just about managing money—it is about managing trust. 39. Your decisions will impact individuals, families, businesses, and communities. You will play a role in financial inclusion, digital adoption, credit growth, and economic stability. That is no small responsibility. So, remember to lead with character and conviction. 40. With this I wish you all the very best in your journey ahead.

The United Nations has declared 2025 as the International Year of Cooperatives, with the theme ‘ Cooperatives Build a Better World ’, recognising the vital role cooperatives play in building inclusive, fair, and resilient communities - something that India’s own cooperative movement has long exemplified. 4. With a proud history of over a century, cooperatives have become powerful engines of grassroots development. From Amul and IFFCO to SEWA and India Coffee House, India’s cooperatives have shown how collective effort can drive both economic and social progress. 5. UCBs have long been an essential part of India’s cooperative story, providing banking services to segments - often underserved by larger banks - small traders, self-employed individuals, salaried workers, and others in the informal sector. What sets UCBs apart is their deep-rooted presence in the community and their ability to offer personalised, responsive service, customers are at ease walking into their neighbourhood UCB branch. This reflects the essence of the cooperative model - banking built on relationships, local knowledge, and grassroots connection. 6. With this unique identity as a cooperative bank, comes a substantive responsibility. While UCBs are rooted in cooperative values, they are banks - licensed to accept public deposits and expected to operate with the same prudence, integrity, and accountability that banking demands. Banking is built entirely on the trust of depositors. Trust must be earned and protected every single day - through sound governance, effective risk management, and an unwavering commitment to depositors’ interests. 7. Recognising both the importance of UCBs and the challenges they face, the Government and the Reserve Bank have taken several steps in recent years to support the sector’s stability and growth. Based on the recommendations of the Expert Committee chaired by former Deputy Governor, Shri N. S. Vishwanathan, a four-tiered regulatory framework was introduced to bring proportionality in regulation. The establishment of a sector-wide Umbrella Organisation was also facilitated to help address issues of scale, particularly in technology and capacity building. Recently, the priority sector lending guidelines for UCBs were revised in response to feedback from the sector. 8. While these measures reflect the commitment of the Reserve Bank and the Government to support and strengthen the UCB sector, lasting progress must ultimately come from within. Government and regulators can enable, but it is the internal resolve and discipline of each institution that will determine its long-term resilience. This calls for a renewed focus on governance, professional management, and strong internal systems. It is therefore essential that you, as Directors, take the lead in building institutions that are capable, forward-looking, compliant, and - most importantly - worthy of the trust placed in them. 9. Let me now turn to five key areas where, as Directors, your role is especially critical. These are not merely regulatory expectations - they are the essential building blocks of strong and sustainable institutions. In each of these areas, your focused attention and leadership can make a meaningful difference to the future of your banks. Strengthening Governance and Accountability 10. My first area is on strengthening governance and accountability. Time and again, our supervisory experience has shown that the root cause of distress in cooperative banks is not external shocks, but weak internal governance. Whether it is high levels of non-performing assets, instances of fraud, or erosion of capital, the underlying issues often trace back to poor oversight, lack of independent judgement, and inadequate checks and balances at the Board level. 11. While you are not expected to manage the day-to-day operations - that is the responsibility of senior management - as Directors, your role is not to merely endorse decisions, but to actively engage, ask the difficult questions, and ensure that the bank is being run in a prudent, ethical, and transparent manner. 12. All dealings must be at arm’s length, and related-party transactions must be approached with utmost caution and full transparency. This applies not only to lending decisions, but also to appointments and other administrative matters - please follow a fair and transparent process without fail. 13. Strong governance begins with active, informed, and independent Boards - Boards that place the long-term interests of the institution and its depositors above all else. Building Robust Assurance Functions 14. The second area I want to highlight is the importance of strong internal assurance functions - namely, risk management, internal audit, and compliance. These are not back-office support roles. They are your eyes and ears within the organisation, helping you identify risks early, monitor controls, and ensure that operations align with regulatory expectations and internal policies. 15. However, these functions can only be effective if they are given the independence, stature, and access they require. They must have the freedom to escalate concerns without fear. They must have the skills and seniority to command respect within the institution. And most importantly, they must have a direct line of communication with the Board - especially with the Audit and Risk Management Committees (especially for those UCBs, where we have mandated RMCs). 16. As Directors, you must engage actively with these functions - not just to review their reports, but to understand what is happening at the ground level. Ask questions. Seek clarifications. Ensure that red flags are not ignored or rationalised. A well-functioning risk, audit, and compliance setup is the foundation of a safe, well-run bank. Engaging Constructively with Auditors and Inspectors 17. The third area I would like to emphasise is your engagement with statutory and internal auditors, as also with supervisory teams. These stakeholders are not adversaries - they are valuable partners in safeguarding the health of your institution. 18. Auditors play a crucial role in independently validating the bank’s financial position and internal controls. Their observations must not be treated as routine or transactional. Engage with them meaningfully. Understand the concerns they raise and ensure that necessary corrective action is taken - not just in form, but in spirit. 19. Likewise, the inspection reports issued by the Reserve Bank should be viewed as a tool for strengthening your bank - not as a fault-finding exercise. These inspections are a critical last line of defence, aimed at identifying risks before they become unmanageable. 20. As Directors, it is essential that you read these reports carefully, discuss them thoroughly at the Board level, and ensure time-bound action on the issues flagged. Avoid the temptation to look for comfort in favourable metrics alone. Instead, focus on understanding the root causes of any weaknesses and most importantly, in fixing them decisively. Embracing Technology with Responsibility 21. The fourth area I want to highlight is the growing importance of technology - and the need to adopt it with foresight and responsibility. 22. In recent years, customer expectations have changed dramatically. Digital payments, mobile banking, and round-the-clock service are no longer luxuries - they are now basic expectations. 23. Many UCBs are eager to offer internet and mobile banking, and that is a welcome aspiration. However, digital services require a strong and secure technological foundation. If the underlying systems are weak, the infrastructure outdated, or the staff unprepared, the bank - and its customers - become vulnerable to serious risks such as fraud, data breaches, and prolonged service disruptions. 24. Cybersecurity is not just a technical issue - it is a governance issue. The Board must be fully aware of the bank’s digital capabilities and its cyber risk profile. Any decision to expand digital offerings must be based on a realistic assessment of readiness and must be accompanied by appropriate investment in systems, processes, and people. 25. Digital transformation should not be about ticking a box or keeping up with trends. It must be a strategic choice, aligned with your bank’s risk appetite, customer profile, and operational capacity. Above all, it must be anchored in a commitment to provide secure and uninterrupted service for your depositors. Supporting Collective Strength through the Umbrella Organisation 26. The fifth area I want to highlight is the importance of collective action - and the opportunity that now lies before the sector through the Umbrella Organisation. 27. In today’s environment, the challenge of limited scale has become more pressing for UCBs - particularly in areas such as technology adoption, cybersecurity, risk management, and compliance. As banking becomes more technology-intensive and regulatory expectations rise, the cost of staying competitive and secure is increasing. For many individual UCBs, making the necessary investments while maintaining profitability is becoming increasingly difficult. The creation of the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Ltd. (NUCFDC) - as an Umbrella Organisation - was a response to this evolving challenge. 28. The Umbrella Organisation is envisioned as a shared platform that can support member banks with common technology solutions, centralised services, capacity-building programmes, and improved access to modern tools and expertise. It can be a force multiplier - especially for smaller UCBs - allowing them to benefit from economies of scale while retaining their unique identity and local focus. NUCFDC is also expected to provide certain fund-based facilities to member banks such as supporting them in capital enhancement, providing refinance, and addressing short term liquidity requirements. 29. The success of this initiative, however, depends on broad-based and active participation. The cooperative movement has always drawn its strength from unity. The Umbrella Organisation offers an opportunity to renew that spirit - by building shared resilience for a digital and dynamic future. Conclusion 30. Let me conclude by reiterating that Urban Cooperative Banks matter. You represent a model that is built not just on profit, but on purpose. 31. As the financial landscape evolves, however, the expectations from you, especially as Directors, are also rising. Governance must be sharper. Risks must be better understood and managed. Technology must be adopted thoughtfully and securely. Above all, the trust of your depositors must remain non-negotiable. 32. Therefore, each of you has both the opportunity and the responsibility to shape the future of your institution. 33. The Reserve Bank stands with you - as a regulator, as a guide, and as a partner. Let us work together to ensure that UCBs remain a strong, resilient, and vibrant part of India’s financial system. 34. Thank you, Jai Hind.",

      "summary": "Distinguished guests, participants, colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me at the outset thank the organisers for having me here to share my thoughts on this important topic. Climate risks and green infrastructure financing, as a catalyst for achieving net-zero emissions, has to move over time from the margins of policymaking to the heart of global and national agenda and occasions such as these should help in this endeavour. 2. Climate change is a phenomenon which we are seeing and living through on a daily basis. With each passing year, the extremes of weather patterns are becoming more intense. Whether it is extreme rainfall, droughts, heat waves or cyclones, changes and aberrations have become the norm. The incidents of formation of heat dome over USA or the monsoon rains hitting Mumbai before the scheduled onset reflect recent examples of the climate change. The probability of changing weather patterns is going to be more regular and its economic impact very severe in the times to come. A recent report 2 on economic cost of extreme weather events estimates that over a ten-year period from 2014 to 2023, economic cost associated with climate-related extreme weather events amounted to $2 trillion. Notably, the estimated cost over the last two years taken together i.e., 2022 and 2023, was around $451 billion. Moreover Climate-induced disasters also disproportionately affect the poorest nations and communities. 3. The scale of the impact of events arising out of climate change therefore requires sizeable investments in technology and scale of finance to both build resilience and enable mitigation. As per OECD report 3 , the investment required for green and sustainable infrastructure is estimated at around USD 3 to USD 5 trillion per year until 2050. This is not just a nominal allocation of capital resources - it would require a significant shift of financial flows, complemented with appropriate policies, and reorientation of institutional priorities. The question is no longer about if but how to finance this transformation, which must then be our collective resolve going forward. Financing sustainable and green infrastructure can no longer remain a peripheral concern; it has to now become central to achieving both global and national net-zero targets, and for fulfilling the commitments of the Paris Agreement. These aspects are important for climate risk mitigation and facilitating a just transition. While more than 140 countries over the world have made commitments to net-zero targets—the real challenge lies in their achievement. Climate finance remains significantly off-track, fragmented, overly reliant on public funds and often inaccessible to the developing countries that need it most. So, the question before us is both urgent and clear: How do we catalyse sustainable and green infrastructure financing to deliver on the promise of net-zero? Let me share a few thoughts on this. Sustainable and Green Infrastructure – The need of the hour 4. For, the current period marked by climate related volatility, limited resources and widening inequality, sustainable and green infrastructure is likely to be a necessity. The infrastructure whether in the form of power plants, highways, apartments, commercial buildings, or fuel pipelines, must be taken as steppingstones towards achieving the goal of net-zero in carbon emissions and not emerge as barriers in achieving these targets. According to a World Bank study 4 , every single dollar invested in climate-resilient infrastructure can save up to four dollars in avoided losses. Green and Sustainable infrastructure not only improves the quality of life through cleaner air, accessible mobility, and more efficient public services, while remaining climate friendly, it also helps in reducing vulnerability and inequality, particularly in communities that are prone to climate risks. Creation of climate resilient infrastructure reduces disaster risks and prevents catastrophic losses from floods, cyclones, and heatwaves. It also reduces the volatility of losses that may occur on corporate balance sheets in the face of physical climate risks, thereby help in improving financial stability. While the arguments for climate resilient infrastructure are compelling, the hurdles are many. It has been estimated 5 that less than 1.5% of total assets under management (AUM) of global investment funds are aligned with Paris goals. Green infrastructure pipelines in emerging markets remain underdeveloped and the climate finance gap which is estimated at over $2.5 trillion annually 6 , is widening. Financing Sustainable and Green Infrastructure – Issues and Challenges 5. While discussing sustainable and green infrastructure, the first step is to establish a clear definition and reach a consensus on what qualifies as green infrastructure. The green taxonomy plays a critical role in this regard. The government has recently released the draft of the climate finance taxonomy for public consultation, which paves the way for much-needed uniform classification across the economy and financial system. The draft taxonomy lays down four essential criteria viz. avoidance of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, reduction of GHG emissions intensity, adaptation solutions that reduce the risk of adverse impacts of climate change and research and development, for classification related to climate finance. But the key to enable sustainable and green infrastructure is technology. New technologies can lead to reduction in emission intensities, increase energy efficiency, provide alternate energy sources to help avoid GHG emissions, and build innovative solutions to drive adaptation and resilience towards mitigating the perils of climate change. 6. This dependence on technology is however both the enabler as well as the main constraint on the flow of finance. Let me elaborate a bit. Finance always follows the principle of risk and reward. Financial institutions adopt risk-based pricing for financial products, considering both the borrower's risk profile and the inherent risks associated with the proposal. The technologies underlying sustainable and green infrastructure are still evolving and are therefore less reliable regarding their future viability as compared to the traditional technologies, which are comparatively stable and have stood the test of time regarding cash flow generation. There may also be lack of technical expertise and capacity among the creditors in understanding these evolving technologies. Hence, compared to traditional technologies, there are higher perceived inherent risks related to sustainable and green infrastructure technologies which then get reflected in their risk pricing. Sustainable and green projects thus often face higher upfront costs including capex requirements. The perceived risks associated with sustainable and green infrastructure limit access to debt financing for early-stage technologies, highlighting the need for greater equity investment (First Loss Default Capital). Other constraints relate to longer payback periods creating asset-liability mismatches, information gaps, lack of robust assurance and verification functions, which limit understanding and appraisal of these technologies to prepare investment-grade infrastructure projects i.e., those with well-defined cash flows, clear governance, and measurable impact metrics. 7. Climate change risks directly impact the real economy, and the financial sector in turn gets impacted on account of its credit exposure to the real economy. For the financial sector to perform a comprehensive risk assessment, relevant information flow from the real economy i.e. corporate/institutional borrowers in a timely manner is important. Given that climate change and climate risks is likely to impact a business segment consisting largely of MSMEs, unorganised sectors and un-listed corporates, creating an awareness and understanding amongst these borrowers on climate change risks and obtaining the required information becomes important. 8. Understanding climate change is an elaborate process involving the use of complex models to analyse the weather and climate patterns to predict the changes. Along with historical data, projections of climate variables such as rainfall, and temperature, are also inputs for forward looking risk estimations. However, the financial system or financial analysts have limited exposure to climate science. At the same time climate scientists have limited understanding of financial modelling and risk estimations. This creates a gap between these two input streams and that challenges us in accurately estimating the risks associated with sustainable and green infrastructure finance. The availability of climate related data with proper understanding about its sources and methodology of its estimation is essential for financial analysts to aid their decision making. 9. Since sustainable and green infrastructure technologies contribute to the reduction or avoidance of greenhouse gas emission intensity, a critical consideration for financing entities is to address the risks of green washing. For a creditor to fund any project which is intended to achieve reductions in GHG emissions, there is a need to clearly understand how these projected reductions are being quantified. It would also require a robust and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) function. Standardised processes and databases to inform and quantify such benefits would be necessary to increase the funding avenues for such infrastructure projects. 10. There are several building blocks or ecosystem enablers which are required to be fostered and promoted to remove the bottlenecks surrounding sustainable and green infrastructure projects. Without innovative financial instruments to mitigate early-stage risks, lack of availability of avenues for blended finance, many projects lack the scale or bankability needed to attract private capital. These limitations are further exacerbated in case of emerging market economies as inadequate financial instruments, and fragmented institutional coordination are critical constraints that are further exacerbated by poor sovereign ratings which leads to further increase in risk premium particularly when trying to access global funds. Global funding, where available, is predominantly denominated in foreign currencies, exposing borrowers to exchange rate risks and consequently increasing the cost of financing - despite their need to access low-cost funds. Moreover, globally climate finance availability is spread across several funds which have different application procedures, eligibility criteria, and reporting standards, which makes it onerous and time consuming for ensuring flow of such funding. These factors lead to institutional paradox with capital seeking sustainability, while sustainable assets seeking capital are unable to scale up and access these funds. Catalysing the finance to Sustainable and Green infrastructure 11. Given the issues and challenges, our focus should be on identifying effective ways to mobilise the financing required to transform our infrastructure landscape toward green and sustainable development. Let me float a few ideas for you to ponder on. To unlock the required flows into green and sustainable infrastructure, we need a holistic reconfiguration of the financial ecosystem - one that rewires risk, institutionalises sustainability, and aligns incentives. We need to follow a building block approach whereby the ecosystem enablers are first put in place, thereafter harmonised and made consistent across all the sectors. We could categorise these enablers in two categories as endogenous and exogenous enablers. The endogenous enablers refer to the requirements of information flow, data gap bridging, MRV requirements, and building up of technical expertise. They can then act as the lynchpin between the availability and requirement of credit flow and cover the entire ecosystem right from the appraisal to disbursement and monitoring of finance related to sustainable and green infrastructure projects. These enablers will prepare the financial system to cater to the financing needs and facilitate the flow of funds with greater certainty. 12. The exogenous enablers would involve mechanisms that can be built to cater to the innate risks associated with green and sustainable infrastructure, which is requirement of risk capital, first loss default capital, concessional funding, quantum of funding, global funding, public and private capital mobilisation. Blended finance, which combines concessional public finance with private capital, is essential for bridging the bankability gap of green and sustainable infrastructure. There is a need for an adequate mix of public and private funding where the public funds crowds in the private funds through appropriate incentive structure. Specific mechanisms need to be enabled wherein global funds scale their mandates from project-level support to market-shaping interventions, also targeting underdeveloped sectors like adaptation infrastructure, and nature-based solutions. There is also requirement for Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), National Development Banks (NDBs) and Vertical Climate and Environmental Funds (VCEFs) to harmonise approach and operations and enable joint funding to enable shift from being direct lenders to catalytic partners and bring in economies of scale in sustainable and green infrastructure projects financing. Instruments like first loss guarantees, and subordinated debt, which can de-risk early-stage investments and crowd in institutional capital are also required. 13. Scalability of finance towards any cause comes either from policy nudges or market mechanisms that adequately incentivises risk taking. Once the endogenous enablers are in place, supported by exogenous enablers, innovative financial instruments such as sustainability linked loans, transition finance instruments, green debt securities etc., can get the required traction for enabling the flow of finance. Digital solutions are changing the way traditional finance works and that innovation needs to be channelised to the cause of sustainable and green infrastructure. Digital tools to automate MRV requirements, and data and information flows, can bring down compliance costs substantially. I would request all the tech enthusiasts to innovate and bring in solutions in this regard. To foster tech-based innovation in finance, RBI has instituted a regulatory sandbox wherein innovative solutions can be tested to provide market wide scalable solutions. RBI has also allowed ‘Theme Neutral’ applications as part of the ‘On Tap’ facility under the regulatory sandbox under which application containing any technology / theme can be made under various topics including sustainable finance and climate risk mitigation. Tokenization may soon enable fractional investment in infrastructure, opening new liquidity channels and investor bases. This approach needs to be explored for sustainable and green infrastructure. Fintech, blockchain, and AI have the power to streamline project verification, improve traceability, and democratise access to green and sustainable finance. We must capitalise on these efforts to establish an infrastructure pipeline of sustainable and green projects, a repository of vetted, investment-ready projects across sectors and regions. We must also empower local governments, indigenous communities, and civil society to lead climate infrastructure efforts. This may include decentralised renewable energy systems, sustainable land use practices, and community-based adaptation projects. 14. No country can achieve net-zero in isolation. Climate change is the quintessential global challenge and so too our response. There is a requirement of enhanced global cooperation in this regard which must also extend to technology transfer, R&D funding, and skills development to enable development of technical expertise to identify, design, and structure bankable sustainable and green infrastructure projects. The focus needs to shift from project-based finance to overall market development with policy reforms, development of a project pipeline, and consistent regulatory frameworks, creating systemic conditions for fostering sustainable and green infrastructure finance. The international financial architecture also needs to be reoriented toward sustainability. The de-risking of sustainable and green infrastructure can work best when national, local, and multilateral institutions co-invest, signalling policy credibility and technical robustness. MDBs and global climate funds may need to revisit their governance structure to reflect the voice of recipient countries, particularly the global south and not just donor countries. Innovative financial instruments such as debt-for-climate swaps and climate-resilient debt clauses must also be scaled up to create fiscal space for green investments. We all need to work towards the creation of a reformed, empowered, and climate-aligned multilateral financial system. Conclusion – Financial Leadership - Call to Action 15. The transition to net-zero is not just about finance, but also about knowledge, trust, and solidarity. We are at the crossroads or in climate terms nearing a tipping point. This is a moment not only for climate policy, but for the financial leadership to act together. A sustainable and green infrastructure is the best legacy we can pass on to the future generations. As finance professionals and leaders, we need to act in unison to foster endogenous and exogenous enablers and build a robust ecosystem to scale climate finance to catalyse green and sustainable infrastructure in a prudent manner. We need to align our mandates and approaches with the country’s net-zero pathways, innovate and strategise and collaborate globally, even as we may act locally. The Reserve Bank of India has been proactive in its resolve to facilitate creation of a robust ecosystem wherein the assessment and mitigation of climate change risks are fostered and its impact on the economy and financial system is curtailed. In this context, we have followed a building block approach, focused on wide stakeholder consultation, capacity development, channelising flow of credit towards green finance, efforts to bridge limitations such as climate data gaps and modelling challenges, and building a conducive regulatory framework for risk assessment balancing compliance and conduct. 16. We need bold and urgent action to finance the future requirements. There is a need to catalyse the capital that helps to build the world we need. Sustainable and green infrastructure is the foundation of climate action, economic resilience, and social justice. It is a significant lever for us to achieve net-zero targets, protect our communities, and create a more equitable world. The future has been built and will continue to be built, one way or another. The question is: will it be sustainable? And what can we do to ensure it? Let me leave you with these thoughts and wish you all successful deliberations and fruitful outcomes during these meetings.

RBI had issued draft directions on Alternative Authentication Mechanisms for Digital Payment Transactions on July 31, 2024 and draft directions on introduction of Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) in cross-border Card Not Present (CNP) transactions on February 07, 2025 , for stakeholder comments. Feedback from the public has been examined and suitably incorporated in the final directions. The directions, inter alia, focus on the following: Encouraging introduction of new factors of authentication by leveraging upon technological advancements. The framework, however, does not call for discontinuation of SMS based OTP as an authentication factor. Enabling issuers to adopt additional risk-based checks beyond the minimum two-factor authentication based on the fraud risk perception of the underlying transaction. Facilitating interoperability and open access to technology Delineating the responsibility of Issuers. Mandating card issuers to validate AFA in non-recurring cross-border CNP transactions whenever such a request is raised by the overseas merchant or acquirer. These directions shall be complied with by April 01, 2026, unless indicated otherwise for any particular direction. (Puneet Pancholy) Chief General Manager Press Release: 2025-2026/1165",
