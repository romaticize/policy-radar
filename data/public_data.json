      "title": "Where Governance Intent is Strong, Regulatory Gaps and Overlaps Fade - Remarks by Shri Swaminathan J, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, on Friday, November 7, 2025, at the Gatekeepers of Governance  Summit in Mumbai -",

      "summary": "Chair of the event, Shri M Damodaran; Chairman, IRDAI, Shri Ajay Seth; Chairman, PFRDA, Shri S Ramann; WTM, SEBI, Shri Kamlesh Varshney and other distinguished guests, colleagues, ladies, and gentlemen. A very good morning to all of you. 2. I am pleased to be here today for the 10th edition of the Gatekeepers of Governance Summit , as conferences like these provide an invaluable platform for the stakeholders to articulate and understand each other’s perspectives. I thank the organisers for this opportunity. 3. Our theme today is simple to ask but hard to answer: “Regulatory gaps and overlaps: do they exist?” I am inclined to agree that they do exist and I propose to address this in two parts, viz. from the standpoint of organisations and thereafter as Regulators. 4. Most organisations often respond to governance questions by redrawing organisation charts, tweaking reporting lines, and updating committee charters. These fixes do help, but only to a point. 5. Business models, technology, and vendor chains change faster than boxes on a slide. As firms expand, digitise, outsource, and integrate, two patterns keep showing up: overlaps - two teams or two regulators asking for the same thing; and gaps - a new product, partner, or dataset sitting outside or at the perimeter of any policy. 6. If we keep editing diagrams without analysing the root cause, we treat symptoms and miss the cause. In my view, the reason, therefore, is “intent” . When intent is strong and governance is lived in spirit, overlaps simplify and gaps close. When intent is weak, the reflex is to add more rules and procedures – multiplying work but losing sight of the real risk. The real question is how deeply good governance is internalised in everyday decisions and board oversight. 7. With that lens, let me focus on five practices that I feel matter most: Boards must own outcomes, not paperwork. Independence should be in substance. Look through the group, not just the entity. Protect and empower the control functions. Governance gap analysis with real remediation. Let me briefly elaborate on each of these five aspects 8. Firstly, boards must own outcomes, not paperwork . A diverse and independent board keeps an organisation on track by overseeing compliance, risk, culture, and ethics. Directors must exercise their duty of care and duty of loyalty, and they must own outcomes 1 . Boards must set risk appetite and outcome goals, and require independent assurance - risk, compliance, and internal audit - to test what matters and report findings, root causes, and their closure. 9. Secondly, independence is not a label; it is the ability to challenge . It is a posture backed by time, information, and courage. Independent directors should be able to challenge strategy, controls, financials, and risk, and to question the assumptions behind forecasts. Our anonymous 2024 survey amongst boards of banks revealed that many boards prefer consensus, and a meaningful minority of directors hesitate to voice dissent. The Chair’s role, therefore, is to draw out quieter views and keep challenge safe. 10. Thirdly, in large conglomerates, risk does not stop at the boundaries of individual entities . Boards should see the whole, not just the parts. Two steps help. First, ring-fence critical entities so a local problem does not become a group crisis. Second, enforce strict related-party policies. Such transactions can be legitimate, but they need transparency, fairness, and arm’s-length terms. Sound rationale and good documentation are evidence of thought and a tool for future learning, not a bureaucratic burden. 11. Fourthly, the three lines of defence must be real . Business lines own risk. Risk management and compliance provide challenge and guardrails. Internal audit tests the system independently. The Heads of assurance functions (the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, and Head of Internal Audit) must have access to the board and to any business line that can create material risk. They should have adequate budgets and full access to information. Decisions on their appointment and removal should rest with the board. Weak lines of defence are to be seen as a board failure, not a staffing glitch. 12. In an anonymous supervisory survey of assurance heads, most reported strong board backing, but almost half said resources do not match their bank’s size and complexity. It is essential to give assurance heads independence, stature, and adequate resources. Otherwise, assurance stays ornamental. 13. Finally, markets move faster than rules and regulations. A periodical governance gap analysis helps organisations see where their policies and frameworks stand against industry best practices - spotting weaknesses, strengthening compliance, and improving risk management 2 . A system-wide perspective 14. Modern business is not tidy. A listed company can be part of a conglomerate with banks, NBFCs, insurers, brokers, payment firms, tech subsidiaries, overseas arms, and associates. The regulatory map is equally rich: Company law and MCA, Securities regulation and listing rules, Sectoral regulators for banking, insurance, pension, competition law, insolvency, accounting and audit oversight, market conduct rules, data and cyber requirements, and multiple enforcement agencies. Add international obligations, exchanges, depositories, SROs, and state-level authorities. 15. In such a world, some overlap is inevitable. That is not a bug. Overlaps can also act as layers of safety net, ensuring that if one control misses an issue, another may catch it. The real problem, may arise from conflicting rules, duplicated compliance, and uncoordinated enforcement which is avoidable. At the same time, new activities, new technologies, and new business models can fall between the cracks. 16. So yes, both gaps and overlaps exist. The task for regulators is to work together, minimising harmful overlaps and closing material gaps, without impeding innovation. In that spirit, let me offer three principles, may be aspirational in parts, for optimising overlaps and gaps. 17. Firstly, regulators must balance entity and activity-based regulation . Regulate the activity wherever it happens, and keep stronger rules for entities that hold public trust. If an app offers investment advice, the advisory guardrails should apply, even if the provider is not a traditional intermediary. If two activities create the same risk, they should face the same rules - regardless of the label or the provider. 18. The second principle is proportionality . Regulators should scale requirements to risk and complexity. A small, simple firm should not bear the same burden as a large, interconnected group; systemically important players should meet higher capital, liquidity, control, and disclosure standards. Proportionality keeps oversight credible and optimal. 19. The third is to strive towards outcome-based regulation, calibrated to market maturity . Where feasible, make and apply rules to protect outcomes - fair customer treatment, resilience, true and fair financials - rather than locking in processes or technologies. For instance, whether onboarding is on paper or biometric, the test is the same: was the customer identified correctly, and was consent captured? However, calibration matters. Outcomes-based rules work best where supervision and enforcement are strong and markets are mature. Conclusion 20. In conclusion, addressing regulatory gaps and overlaps is a journey of continuous improvement that demands constant reflection, adaptation, and courage to challenge the status quo. When intent is strong, the gaps bridge, overlaps simplify, and governance transcends mere compliance to become our shared conscience. Thank you.

      "summary": "Shri Setty, Chairman, SBI, Shri Amara, MD, SBI, distinguished leaders and members of the financial fraternity. It gives me immense pleasure to be a part of what feels like, and perhaps is, the nerve centre of the Indian financial system. 2. The theme of the Conclave ‘India’s Quest for Self-Reliance in a Fragmented World Order’, makes this event particularly timely and critical. The comfortable assumptions of the post-Cold War era of globalisation are fading as we are seeing a re-emergence of protectionist tendencies and re-shoring of critical supply chains. Economies and societies are struggling to adjust not just to the rapid pace of change of technology, but also as the fundamental nature of technology itself is undergoing a paradigm shift. Technology has always been a catalyst for improving efficiency in delivering financial products, but now it has become the very foundation upon which the future of financial intermediation rests. Technology and Banks 3. Today I want to dwell on a theme that reverberates in the current era of disruptions and fast-paced changes, the role of technology in banking . Every aspect of finance, from payments and credit to savings, investments, regulation and supervision, is already being redefined through technology. 4. With powerful technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing already under way, our challenge is how to embrace them with wisdom and purpose, and ensure that technological evolution is secure, inclusive, resilient, and future-ready. 5. India’s experience in digitisation shows that countries who harness technology with foresight and responsibility will not only adapt to change but shape it. Our uniquely successful model of leveraging Digital Public Infrastructures (DPIs) like Aadhaar or UPI has not only positioned India as a leading example of digitisation, but also it has set an example for other countries to follow. For transformational change, it is not enough that technology is ubiquitous, it should also be foundational. Lessons from India’s Digital Journey 6. If we look back today, we can see that India’s banking system has passed through two-and-a-half decades of innovations in payment technology – starting from ATM networking and moving through a gamut of retail and wholesale digital payment instruments like RTGS, NEFT and IMPS to the game-changing UPI and continuing on to experimenting with digital currency. The journey has been gradual yet, transformational. What are the main lessons that we can glean from this experience that has placed India as a leading example of payments innovation? The very first thing to note is that virtually all of these initiatives came from the public sector, whether it is the ATM Switch, or NEFT/RTGS or UPI or, moving slightly away from the financial sector, the Aadhaar. Even the initiatives to set up key institutions – IDRBT, NPCI, IFTAS, and more recently, RBIH – were all public sector initiatives. The second aspect is that all of these initiatives were by way of creating infrastructures, specifically digital public infrastructures. They were situated in what can be termed a public goods space; they were priced like public goods – minimal charges or free; they were accessible by all, like public goods. Thirdly, these DPIs were made available as a foundational layer for technology firms to create innovation. This gave the Indian approach a uniquely public-private cooperation character, an approach that resulted in the best of both worlds - while the public sector focuses on what it does best – create public infrastructure, the private sector focuses on where it has clear competitive advantage - innovation. Fourthly, open access to DPIs led to a rise of new fintech players such as payment aggregators, PPI issuers, third-party app providers, etc, bringing agility, innovation, and particularly scale. DPI has thus contributed to the growth of the fintech sector itself. Finally, there is a general realisation that the new fintech players, mainly because they had no legacy systems that tied them down, were far more nimble and innovative than incumbent banks. While this did not undermine the role of banks as such, it exposed the Achilles heel of the banking system – that banks could be vulnerable to strong inertia in adapting to new technology. This leads me to the basic theme of my talk – the nature of the challenges new technology poses for banks. Banks and new Fintechs 7. Let me first explain the vulnerability by using the context of UPI. UPI is essentially a payment instrument that transfers funds from one bank account to another (it can also use wallets, but that is a negligible part of the volume, so we will ignore it for this purpose). All UPI transactions are therefore payment transactions made through banks. Yet when we talk of UPI, the first entity that comes to mind is not a bank but a non-bank UPI app. It is well recognized that these fintech entities have taken UPI to where it is today, and that but for them UPI would not have been able to reach the nooks and corners of the country. Acquisition of customers and their payments data, was enough of an incentive for these app providers to extend these services even in the absence of any revenue. It is also important to appreciate that these FinTechs had certain basic advantages - Technology edge – Fintechs are more agile as they have no legacy IT systems, enabling them to use technology that is more conducive to scale up, integrate and upgrade. Banks, with their core banking systems find it difficult to modernise and upgrade. Data advantage - Fintechs can access wider, larger and more comprehensive data sources (for example across multiple banks and spending channels). Cost advantage – With asset light balance sheets, no physical branches and very little due diligence requirements (KYS, AML/CFT etc), these fintechs incur a lot less cost than banks. 8. These advantages were large, and it can be reasonably argued that banks were unfairly disadvantaged (higher regulatory burden, frictions of KYC process and AML checks). In a competitive market, banks would have recovered their higher costs from the fintechs, but then, adoption of new technology would probably have suffered. But even without these disadvantages, it would be reasonable to assume that banks just did not foresee the potential in UPI that the FinTechs did. Part of the explanation lies in the very nature of banks. 9. Banks are special entities, unlike any other business. They have an important socioeconomic role, that of creating money. Because of this role, banks are licensed and closely regulated and supervised. This arrangement works to the benefit of banks, because entry is not free and there is some degree of underwriting by the State. It also has a disadvantage that banks have to bear the cost of regulation, both financially and in terms of the obligation to follow prudential processes. One corollary of this somewhat protected environment within which banks operate is that their innovation edge is blunted. This is probably the reason banks did not fully appreciate the potential benefits of UPI, as keenly as the fintech players did. 10. If this indeed is true, it is time the banking system thought hard and deep about the challenges from the transformational technology changes we are living through. Technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum and digital currencies, will shape the next decade of financial transformation. These technologies pose challenges that are fundamental to banks. Most money in modern economies is bank money. Creating money through extending credit is the most basic function of a bank. The advent of digital currencies is now providing an alternative. We can no longer assume that banks would always remain because who else would create money, that is the lifeblood of modern economies. The risks from private digital currencies to banks appears existential, yet not well understood or debated globally. Even with CBDCs, which become a necessary bulwark against private digital currencies, banking business is likely to change significantly, and these impacts need to be understood by banks. It is not just the responsibility of a central bank, the issuer. Banks are the core intermediaries in financial markets. Every financial transaction, whether or not it requires other types of intermediaries (e.g., brokers or market-makers) would always require a bank to authenticate the payment leg. This is something only a bank could do. With the blockchain technology, this could well change. The basic function of a blockchain is to authenticate financial transactions in the absence of a trusted intermediary. It is now possible that banks may not be required to authenticate payments, substantially impacting their role as intermediaries. 11. Apart from these fundamental challenges, new technology poses various other risks to the roles that banks traditionally play. For instance, digital currencies can provide a superior alternative to banks in cross-border payments. Quantum computing, though nascent, could one day revolutionise encryption, risk modelling, and portfolio optimisation. AI can interpret blockchain data; CBDC can embed smart contracts; IoT devices can trigger automated financial settlements. Together, they signal a shift from a system of intermediated finance to one of intelligent interconnections. 12. The risks emanating from these technological shifts need to be recognized and understood. True, at this stage these risks are more conceptual than actual, yet at the very least they can eat into the exclusive domain of banks. Banks, therefore need to be prepared well to meet these challenges and maintain their central role in monetary transmission and financial stability. 13. While by now banks have a fairly good understanding of how to approach technology adoption, I would only reiterate a few aspects that need to be kept in mind with respect to adopting the new transformational technologies. Banks have inherent strengths - credibility, balance sheet depth and customer base. Technology asymmetry tends to dilute these benefits. The ability to leverage these strengths would depend on the agility and speed with which banks modernize their systems and reimagine their business processes. The nature of technology change facing banks is different. Many technology changes are no longer incremental, they are re-architectural. Platform technologies effectively enable nonbanks to come into the banks’ domain. Distributed ledgers undermine the traditional institutional guarantees that banks provided. Therefore, competitiveness may no longer depend as much on balance sheet strength but on data capability and technology flexibility. Since banks are structurally vulnerable because of their monolithic IT systems and high fixed costs arising from branch network and compliance costs, incremental digitisation is unlikely to be enough to keep them competitive. 14. In this context, what can be the strategic imperatives for banks to prepare for transformative technologies? Modernising core infrastructure to make it less monolithic and rigid is one such imperative if banks have to compete with the fintech ecosystem. Adopting a platform orientation and API based collaboration with fintechs is another. Perhaps the most important requirement is reengineering the culture of innovation within banks and creating incentives for learning and skill upgradation from within. Human expertise to innovate, govern, and responsibly deploy technology remains the differentiator in a digital world. Institutions must cultivate deep digital and data skills at all levels, ensuring teams are equipped to navigate complexity and seize opportunities. 15. Equally importantly, banks need to treat fintechs as partners in innovation and create a mutually beneficial or symbiotic strategic partnerships with them. The objective should be to benefit from the agility of fintechs without compromising prudential discipline. Concluding thoughts 16. As we reflect on the transformative absorption of technology in finance, one truth is unmistakable i.e., while technology is inevitable, its direction is intentional. The choices banks make today will shape not only the architecture of their IT systems but the experience, inclusion, and trust of millions of citizens tomorrow. As technology is rewriting the very DNA of finance, the preparedness of banks will determine whether they lead this transformation or are led by it. Institutions that adopt technology strategically, embed strong governance principles, develop human capital, and collaborate across the ecosystem will not only navigate change but will shape it.",

      "summary": "I am delighted to be here amongst all of you in the SBI Banking and Economics Conclave. I sincerely thank Chairperson, SBI for providing me this opportunity to address the leaders of the banking and finance in the country. This Conclave is happening at a time when we are navigating a world of continued uncertainty, geopolitical realignment, and rapid technological change. This brings not only a host of challenges but also many opportunities. 2. I recall that about a year ago, when I addressed this Conclave in my capacity as Revenue Secretary, I spoke about tax reforms. In my address today, I propose to dwell on the recent regulatory measures the RBI has taken. Earlier, we had issued the Regulation making Framework. We follow a consultative process, do an impact analysis and provide the objectives of the regulations. In the spirit of this framework, I wish to shed some more light on the objectives and the rationale of the major regulations. The Purpose of “Regulation” 3. In this context, I would also like to reiterate what I said in my first MPC statement in February this year. The interest of the national economy demands financial stability. For us in the Reserve Bank, financial stability remains the north star, for short term growth achieved at the cost of financial stability can have bigger consequences for long-term growth. Research shows that financial instability may not only more than offset the gains of higher short term growth, but also make recovery more distressful and longer. 4. At the same time, economic interest warrants increasing efficiency, and promoting innovation, which too is our duty. We recognise that just like there are no free lunches, regulation to enhance stability too is not devoid of costs. There are trade-offs between stability and efficiency. 5. I had assured that we will keep this trade-off in mind while formulating regulations. I had mentioned that it will be our attempt to strike the right balance, keeping in view the benefits and costs of each and every regulation. The recent regulatory proposals strive to maintain this balance - the balance between the drive to innovate and grow and the duty to protect. 6. Moreover, in a rapidly evolving banking system, underpinned by technological advancements of tectonic magnitude, no regulator can afford to situate the system at a point in time. The role of the regulator is to guide its evolution within guardrails that ensure stability, fairness, and resilience. 7. In India, this philosophy has found steady expression in RBI’s approach towards regulation, what might be called responsive conservatism - a model that prizes stability yet remains open to reform. The Backdrop 8. In this context, it would be germane to briefly recap the developments over the past decade in the Indian financial system. 9. Post GFC, in the wake of aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus, the ensuing regulatory forbearance sowed the seeds of the “twin balance sheet” problem - overleveraged corporates and stressed bank balance sheets. Coupled with the manifestation of external sector vulnerabilities, India got clubbed among the so-called “Fragile Five.” 10. Guided by the principle “ never waste a good crisis ”, the period from 2014 led to a foundational surgery to restore the long-term health of the financial system. 11. This was driven by a series of regulatory measures aimed at recognition, resolution and recapitalisation of the banking system. The Asset Quality Review (AQR), initiated in 2015, compelled banks to recognise the true state of their loan books, bringing hidden NPAs onto balance sheets. Significant improvements were also brought about in the supervisory framework. 12. Simultaneously, Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework helped restore the health of weak banks. It was followed by consolidation of 27 public sector banks into 12 by 2020. These measures were complemented by a massive recapitalisation programme, which strengthened capital buffers and restored their capacity to resume healthy lending. 13. The introduction of IBC in 2016, and the pursuant resolution paradigm introduced through out of court workout mechanisms, have fundamentally transformed India’s credit culture. 14. Parallelly, major reforms were undertaken to strengthen monetary and macroeconomic stability, including the adoption of a flexible inflation-targeting regime, deepening of forex markets, and the gradual liberalisation on the capital account. 15. The recent past has also seen structural transformation of financial intermediation into a sophisticated and layered system. Nimble FinTechs and NBFCs now assume a greater role in sourcing and origination. Development of capital markets and credit risk transfer channels such as securitisation now provide a conduit for risk transfers. The Project Finance Directions issued recently, address risks arising from regulatory approvals and availability of land. The proposed forward-looking ECL provisioning will help early recognition of deterioration in asset quality. 16. Moreover, Indian banks today are far more mature than they were a decade ago. To put this in perspective, credit and deposits have expanded to almost 3 times 1 . Capital buffers have strengthened too - the CRAR rose from 13.5 per cent as on 31st March, 2015 to 17.5 per cent as on 31st March, 2025 with CET-1 increasing from 10.43 per cent to 14.73 per cent during the same period. Asset quality has also improved. GNPA and NNPA have reduced to 2.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent in March 2025 after rising to highs of 11.2 per cent and 5.96 per cent respectively in March 2018. Profitability of banks has enhanced significantly. Between FYs 2017-18 and 2024-25, Return on Assets increased from -0.24 per cent to 1.37 per cent, and Return on Equity jumped from -2 per cent to 14 per cent. Regulation cannot ignore this performance, these changed realities. 17. This evolution implies that prudential rulebooks too should evolve in a calibrated manner as banks are now stronger and supervision more alert even as alternative risk-bearing pillars have deepened and market-based risk transfer mechanisms have become more effective. 18. The recent regulatory measures need to be seen in the backdrop of these developments. Let me now elaborate on a few measures. Capital Market Exposure (CME) 19. I will first talk about the draft guidelines on capital market exposure. The proposals to enhance the limits for lending to individuals against securities and rationalise the norms for lending to capital market intermediaries are part of the normal process of review, seeking to reset the limits, set way back in 1999. Importantly, the revision in limits has been accompanied by a more structured Loan to Value (LTV) framework, sensitive to the risks of the underlying securities. 20. The proposed removal of limits on loans against debt instruments, while retaining the regulatory limits for equity instruments, recognises the fundamental difference between the two instruments from a risk perspective. The key risk a debt instrument carries is credit risk, and just like loans, credit risk is expected to be managed as part of the broader credit risk management framework. An additional comforting factor is that only listed and investment grade debt securities are proposed to be permitted as collateral. This rationalisation is also expected to foster a virtuous positive feedback loop for the development of the bond market. 21. As regards acquisition finance, it is acknowledged as an integral element of an evolved financial system, that helps in better allocation of financial resources. Recognising its need, non-bank players such as NBFCs and bond markets are already allowed to provide such funding. Removal of the restriction on banks will benefit the real economy. The proposed guardrails like limiting bank funding to 70 per cent of deal value, limits on debt to equity ratio, aggregate exposure limits relative to Tier-1 capital, and eligibility criteria will contain concentration and credit risks, thereby ensuring safety while allowing banks and their stakeholders to reap benefits of additional business. Market Mechanism for Large Borrowers 22. Let me now turn to the withdrawal of the Specified Borrower Framework. 23. This framework was instituted almost a decade ago, in a very different financial environment. This is a unique measure, which perhaps no other country that has implemented the Large Exposure framework (LEF), at the bank level, has. At that time, the banking system was grappling with elevated levels of stress, which is no longer the case. The tier 1 capital of the scheduled commercial banks has increased 3.2 times from about 8 lakh crore rupees in 2016 to more than 26 lakh crore rupees in the last ten years. On the other hand, overall share of exposure of the banks to corporates has considerably reduced since then. The regulatory landscape, as mentioned earlier, too has evolved significantly. The large exposure framework, which is aligned with international best practices, is now well-established and the supervisory tool kit is vastly improved. Therefore, it is proposed to substitute the blanket risk weights and provisions in the extant framework with better monitoring and risk management by the banks. Reduction in Risk Weights for Infrastructure exposures of NBFCs 24. Coming to risk weights for infrastructure exposures of NBFCs, I would like to highlight that the proposal seeks to prescribe risk weights on the basis of the risk profile of the exposures. However, certain conditions have to be satisfied to qualify for a lower risk weight: one, there is a set of qualitative criteria that has to be fulfilled ab initio, including a suitable covenant to protect the interest of creditors through the tenor of the exposure; and two, a principal repayment criteria that would demonstrate a reasonable performance track record before risk weights can be lowered. Revision in ECB norms 25. As regards, the External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) framework, these measures come against the backdrop of a strong external sector. India’s current account recorded a surplus of USD 13.5 billion (1.3 per cent of GDP) in Q4 FY25, followed by a modest deficit of USD 2.4 billion (0.2 per cent of GDP) in Q1 FY26. Foreign exchange reserves stand at about USD 690–700 billion, sufficient to cover nearly 11 months of merchandise imports. Capital account remains robust. Net inflows to India under foreign investment (FDI and FPI), external commercial borrowings and NRI deposits stood higher at USD 30.4 bn during April-July 2025 than USD 26.8 bn in the same period last year. Our projections show that capital flows will remain quite strong during the rest of the year as well. 26. The recalibration of the ECB framework is a natural step in India’s financial evolution - grounded in strong fundamentals, guided by prudence, and inspired by confidence in the economy’s capacity to engage with global finance on its own terms. 27. The removal of all-in-cost ceilings will encourage competitive rates and promote prudent hedging behaviour. Expansion of the universe of eligible lenders will improve pricing efficiency. 28. Linking the borrowing limits to the borrower’s net worth under automatic route links ECB to the strength of the borrower, while enhancing ease of doing business. This limit and the overall soft ceiling of total outstanding ECBs at 6.5 per cent of GDP will mitigate the risks of excessive external leverage. 29. Moreover, I wish to clarify that ECBs are proposed to be permitted only for FDI-compliant real estate projects and remain prohibited for speculative real estate activity such as land or property trading. Epilogue Appropriate and incremental regulations 30. To summarise, all these measures are balanced and appropriate, built on the bedrock of a banking system that has been systematically fortified over the last decade, with financial stability remaining the unwavering cornerstone of our policy architecture. All the changes are incremental in nature. As Shakespeare would say, we are moving wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast 2 . At the same time when we aspire to become a developed nation, while we move with caution, we need to display courage. Again, I am reminded of Shakespeare’s line 3 : Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but … out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. So, these measures do reflect fresh thinking, but are incremental and do not introduce any sea change. Regulation as a whole 31. Moreover, no regulatory measure can be understood in isolation. Each measure has to be seen in the continuum of regulatory evolution and not in isolation. These proposals must be read against the broader regulatory scaffolding, which mitigates the risks. Together, the regulations create a multi-layered defence, to keep systemic risk in check. Analysing merely one regulation without understanding the complete regulatory landscape risks missing the forest for the trees. Amendments based on experience 32. Let me also highlight that the higher responsibilities placed on the banks are based on their past performance. This is on account of the improved governance and prudent decision-making by the banks over the last decade. As highlighted earlier, capital buffers are stronger, profitability better, and asset quality much improved. Regulation has to evolve keeping in mind the realities of time and the performance of the banks. Promote learning and discovery 33. Moreover, no regulator can, or should, substitute for boardroom judgment, especially in a diverse country such as ours. Each case, each loan, each deposit, each transaction is different, with varying risks and opportunities. We need to allow the regulated entities to take decisions based on merits of each case, rather than prescribing a one size fits all rule. This will enable regulated entities to experiment and innovate, learn and improve. Regulations with guardrails 34. At the same time, wherever we are allowing hitherto prohibited activities, or reducing restrictions, we have provided sufficient guardrails to ensure safety and prudence. Regulation and supervision go hand in hand 35. I may also mention that the role of a regulator is like that of a gardener whose job does not stop with providing the “enabling environment” for the growth of the plants. The gardener keeps on monitoring the growth of the plant and prune unwanted growth to shape a collective orderly beautiful garden . RBI has ample tools - risk weights, provisioning norms, countercyclical buffers - to contain emerging risks. History shows our readiness to act, as seen most recently in the macroprudential measures of increasing risk weights on consumer credit in November 2023. Needless to say, supervisory actions have always enabled effective backstops to prune unwanted growth and shape a robust and resilient banking system. 36. Finally, let me emphasise that most of these are measures are in the form of drafts issued for formal consultation. These have been issued after great deliberation, informal consultation and thought, accompanied with detailed impact assessment, and while they do reflect the broad direction, they are not final. We will finalise them after taking inputs from all stakeholders. Consumer grievance redress 37. Before I conclude, let me also touch upon the changes introduced with respect to consumer grievances. The Reserve Bank has maintained a persistent focus on enhancing customer service standards and strengthening grievance redressal systems. 38. In this direction, the Internal Ombudsmen framework in larger REs is proposed to be improved. The Reserve Bank Ombudsman Scheme is also being further fine-tuned to enhance its efficacy. 39. To sustain the regulator’s efforts, it is imperative that regulated entities address customer grievances through mechanisms that are fair, transparent, timely, and without undue cost. The regulated entities may please assess the quality of customer service through periodic and regular thematic studies. In addition, effective Root Cause analysis of the grievances may also be conducted to identify systemic issues, process gaps and repetitive grievances and remedial measures taken. 40. I would request the MD&CEOs and other top executives present here for their full support and their personal attention in ensuring that the proposed changes, when they are made final, are implemented not only in letter but also in spirit. Conclusion 41. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that our approach is calibrated: granting banks greater commercial leeway for growth, innovation and ease of doing business, while ensuring that risks are minimised and financial stability is maintained. 42. We have set ourselves an ambitious goal of becoming an advanced economy by 2047. The financial sector has a large role to play in it. RBI remains steadfastly committed to this goal. We will ensure that our financial system evolves responsibly to support innovation, growth, and long-term economic resilience. 43. I am sure that the deliberations in this Conclave will help in taking forward this developmental agenda. I commend SBI for this initiative and wish the Conclave a huge success. 44. Thank You.

      "summary": "It is a pleasure for me to be here at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit. I would like to thank the organisers for this opportunity. 2. In my brief comments, I will be reflecting on the observed economic and financial resilience of emerging markets (EMs) in general, and of the Indian economy, in particular. In this context, it may be noted that at the recently concluded Annual Meetings of the IMF, two contradictory themes prevailed: the unprecedented global policy uncertainty; and the surprising resilience of the economies. 2 3. The global economy has shown remarkable resilience to the shifting trade policies and geopolitical tensions. Global growth has held up better than anticipated earlier. Currently, inflation outlooks are mostly benign across countries (notwithstanding the fact that inflation levels in some advanced economies are somewhat higher than their respective targets). Low inflation has provided the headroom for monetary policies to be eased across jurisdictions. Banking sectors across countries are mostly resilient. 3 4. IMF has suggested a few factors that are contributing to this resilience. 4 These include improved policy frameworks in EMs; the tariff outcomes being milder than what were anticipated earlier; and very limited retaliation by the partner countries. 5 In other words, the policy making frameworks in EMs are to be credited for their own economic resilience, as well as for the resilience in the global economy. The key questions of interest, therefore, are: What has made this resilience of EMs possible? Is it here to stay? How well has India done on its policy frameworks and economic resilience? How has the observed economic and financial resilience in EMs been achieved? 5. After completing my Master's in Economics at the Delhi School of Economics and teaching for two years at Delhi University, I joined graduate school in 1993. In my second year, I enrolled in a course on International Finance. The year was 1994 and a balance of payments crisis was unfolding in Mexico, which spread to Argentina and select other Latin American economies, with the risk of far-reaching contagion to many other countries and regions. Despite having witnessed the 1991 crisis at home, I did not have sufficient exposure to the literature on such crises at that time. 6. While taking this course, and subsequently while pursuing my own research in this area, I learnt more systematically about the pitfalls of unsustainable macroeconomic frameworks. These frameworks at that time consisted of: a fixed exchange rate regime which often resulted in appreciation and eroded competitiveness of the real exchange rate and large current account deficits. Premature and rapid liberalisation of the capital account and financial sector, resulting in excessive external borrowing, often in foreign currency (called the Original Sin) 6 . Lax fiscal policy and weak fiscal institutions, which combined with ad hoc monetary policy frameworks and limited independence of the central banks resulted in fiscal dominance and pronounced electoral-fiscal cycles, high inflation, and limited policy credibility. 7 7. It became evident at that time that volatile capital flows, often triggered by external forces, could upend fragile equilibriums characterised by such macroeconomic frameworks. In fact, many more countries, which had such frameworks in place, experienced balance of payment crises in the following years. These included, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines during the Asian crisis of 1997-98; Brazil and Russia in 1998; and South Africa and Turkey in 2001. 8 It also became evident that these currency crises could even engulf the banking sector, resulting in \"twin crises\" with far graver implications. 9 8. In the ensuing years, extensive discussions, introspections, analyses, and research were undertaken within EMs as well as at the multilateral institutions. This culminated in a number of policy reforms undertaken by countries towards sounder macroeconomic management, as they learnt from each other, and were supported by the multilateral institutions. 9. Since early-mid 2000s, EMs have become more cautious in their approach towards the external sector. They have maintained a flexible exchange rate policy (mostly managed floats rather than free floats). They have reduced their liability dollarisation. They have slowed and recalibrated the pace and sequencing of capital account liberalisation. They have built up large foreign exchange reserves to act as a cushion against the adverse impact of external shocks to their balance of payments. In other words, they use their foreign exchange reserves to modulate large fluctuations in the exchange rate, or to meet the demand for foreign exchange emanating from a sudden shock to current account or reversal of capital flows. 10. In addition, they have strengthened their domestic macroeconomic policy frameworks by implementing credible fiscal rules, and have adopted a rule-based framework for monetary policy with inflation targeting or other close alternatives. They have strengthened their banking and financial sectors. Alongside, they have significantly enhanced the independence of their central banks. 11. As a result of these policy efforts, the world for the most part has not witnessed any country-specific or even regional Balance of Payments crises (barring a handful of exceptions) during the last two and a half decades. 10 This resilience has been markedly visible during the last five years when, EMs had to face multiple shocks in succession, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021), Russia-Ukraine war (2022) and other geopolitical tensions, surge in inflation resulting in synchronised monetary tightening by Advanced Economy central banks (2022-2023), and the ongoing trade policy and tariff shocks (2025). The fact that EMs, by and large, are able to tide over these shocks with relative macroeconomic stability is a testament to the success of aforementioned policy efforts. 12. This is not to say that the EMs do not face policy challenges anymore. They do. But instead of macroeconomic stability issues, EMs face greater risks to sustained growth, and meaningful employment generation. 13. Their key challenge lies in finding the new sources of growth. In learning to live in a world in which trade as an engine of growth is faltering, and, therefore, domestic sources of growth need to play a larger role. 14. The acceleration in economic growth witnessed across EMs in 2000s was driven by a rapid expansion in global trade. The ratio of world trade to GDP increased from about 41 per cent in 1994 to 61 per cent in 2008. 11 Since the global financial crisis of 2008-09, however, the global trade to GDP ratio has flattened, reducing the avenues for EMs to grow faster by leveraging global demand. 15. More recently, a new threat to global trade has emerged from the increased incidence of protectionism. Apart from reducing the contribution of external demand to growth, these developments also reduce the impact of potential spillover benefits to domestic growth through channels such as technology transfer. Even as some of the trade relations will be rebuilt and others will evolve during the course of time, the years of hyper globalisation are unlikely to return anytime soon. 16. Neither is the manufacturing sector turning out to be a sure way to economic success (the potential of the manufacturing sector seems to have become limited due to the existing large players continuing to be market leaders). 17. Another challenge, especially for those economies where demography is still favourable, is that under employment remains high, gender gaps remain wide, and a large share of workers remain in less productive informal jobs. 18. For some of the EMs, high public debt is also of concern. Many EMs undertook fiscal consolidation after they were hit by the crises in the 1990s. However, after the global financial crisis, public debt has risen steadily, exacerbated further by cascading shocks such as the fiscal stimulus during the pandemic, and higher interest burden of debt servicing from policy tightening. While there is no imminent risk to debt sustainability in EMs, elevated public debt poses a challenge in financing their developmental goals in the wake of rising interest payments to service this debt. Where does India stand on the resilience of its policy framework? 19. India's policy frameworks have continued to evolve and are currently among the global best. Its exchange rate, that was pegged until 1991, is increasingly market driven. Its external account has been managed well. There are inherent strengths in its diversified balance of payments. On the current account, the merchandise trade deficit has been balanced by strong services exports and remittances receipts. Oil price is not a dampener that it used to be. All in all, the current account shows resilience and is eminently in a sustainable zone. 12 20. The capital account too gets a variety of inflows, including FDI inflows that are traditionally known to be stable; and other equity and debt flows, which are traditionally known to be relatively fickle, but have held up well. India has slowly but surely liberalised its capital account, but the external debt as a proportion to GDP has been low and stable. The ratio of external debt to GDP has averaged around 20.5 per cent in the last 10 years (end-March 2015 to end-March 2025); as of end-June 2025, external debt to GDP ratio was 18.9 per cent. Besides keeping the liability dollarisation in check, India's short-term debt level too has remained low. The ratio of Short-term Debt (original maturity) to total debt was 18.1 per cent as of end-June 2025. 21. India has largely adhered to the path of fiscal consolidation, barring periods of significant shocks such as the pandemic. Importantly, the composition of debt, and the improved quality of public spending has rendered public debt safe. Most of the public debt is long term, is denominated in local currency, and is held domestically (a large part of which is held by institutional investors). Furthermore, a favourable growth and interest rate differential has made current level of public debt sustainable. 13 22. Flexible Inflation Targeting framework for monetary policy, introduced in 2016, was a major structural reform in India. Evidence points towards improved outcomes post adoption of flexible inflation targeting: inflation has become lower and less volatile; inflationary expectations are better anchored; and the transmission of monetary policy has become more effective. Inflation targeting has brought in greater transparency to policy making. Frequent communication has helped in anchoring expectations and in building credibility. There is continuous engagement with stakeholders, making monetary policy a two-way consultative process. 23. As a result of the full matrix of policy reforms, India's GDP and per capita income growth rates have accelerated over time; growth has been among the highest globally; and its variability has declined. 14 24. India's near-term growth outlook is promising too. After growing at a stronger than anticipated rate of 7.8 per cent during Q1:2025-26, various high frequency indicators point towards a robust expansion in Q2:2025-26 as well. In the latest monetary policy statement, growth forecast for FY2025-26 has been revised upwards to 6.8 per cent. Inflation currently is at an eight-year low of 1.5 per cent. As per the latest assessment of the RBI, CPI inflation is projected to be 2.6 per cent for the full year 2025-26, much below the target. Concluding thoughts 25. Having learnt from the crisis decade of the 1990s, EMs have put in place policy frameworks and decision-making processes that have made them less vulnerable to macroeconomic and financial instability. India has been a frontrunner in implementing these reforms. As a result, while the intensity of external shocks may not have declined, the variability of the macroeconomic outcomes has moderated considerably. This economic resilience has enabled the policy makers to focus on reforms to enhance productivity, facilitate ease of doing business, and improve the quality of financial intermediation. Such collective efforts are surely putting India on the path to graduate from an emerging to an emerged market status in the coming decades (and possibly even in the coming years). 1 Inputs received from Asish Thomas George, GV Nadhanael, and Somnath Sharma, and comments received from Indranil Bhattacharya, Anupam Prakash, Sunil Kumar, Sangita Misra and Satyashiba Panigrahi are gratefully acknowledged. 2 We are focusing here more on EMs, not on advanced economies or low-income economies which have their own unique economic features, potentials and challenges. 3 IMF and other multilateral agencies have also been pointing to the various risks that loom on the horizon. They refer to buoyant equity markets (particularly led by technology stocks) leading to worries that a correction could be in the offing. Central banks of advanced economies are concerned about elevated public debt in their respective economies and worry that there might be a disruptive resolution. The financial landscape has undergone significant change over the years, with non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) now playing a larger role in several markets, including the bond and credit markets. The growing size, complexity, and interconnectedness of these lightly regulated NBFIs in the financial system has raised financial stability concerns. 4 World Economic Outlook, October 2025. 5 Adaptability and entrepreneurship of the private sector and supportive financial conditions are the other factors. 6 Eichengreen, B. J., Hausmann, R., & Panizza, U. (2002). Original sin: the pain, the mystery, and the road to redemption. 7 I ended up writing two of the three papers in my PhD thesis on Twin Crises--when Balance of Payments and Banking Crises occur simultaneously and feed each other. 8 These have alternatively been called Currency Crises, Balance of Payments Crises or Sudden Stops. 9 Kaminsky, Graciela, L., and Carmen M. Reinhart. (1999). \"The Twin Crises: The Causes of Banking and Balance-of-Payments Problems.\" American Economic Review 89 (3): 473–500. 10 Frontier markets are not similarly insulated, their policy frameworks not having been similarly evolved. 11 Source: World Bank. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS 12 During the last 10 years, the current account deficit (as % of GDP) remained in the range of 0.6 to 2.1 per cent, barring the COVID year (2020-21) where it recorded a surplus of 0.8 per cent. 13 Another crucial factor is that, of the total debt of the government of India, external debt consists less than 5 per cent, which mitigates the external sector risks (Receipts Budget 2025-26, Government of India). 14 Indian economy grew by an average of 7.8 per cent during the last three years (2022-23 to 2024-25) making it the fastest growing major economy. CPI inflation declined from a peak of 6.7 per cent in 2022-23 to 4.6 per cent in 2024-25. As per the latest available data, CPI inflation was at 1.5 per cent in September 2025.",

      "summary": "1. It is a pleasure to welcome all of you to this High-Level Dialogue on Forging Economic Resilience through Digital Public Platforms (DPPs). 2. Thank you for accepting our invitation to be a part of this dialogue. As key decision makers of your esteemed institutions, entrusted with safeguarding the economic heath and resilience of your respective economies, your presence amidst us today adds great value to this occasion. 3. I expect an enriching and fruitful discussion on today’s topic. It is of critical importance, as it has the potential to significantly enhance the economic well-being of our people. 4. India is an excellent example of how digital public platforms (DPPs) can impart tangible economic benefits and materially improve the lives of our citizens. I. Digital Public Platforms 5. During India's G20 Presidency, Digital Public Platforms were formally defined as a set of shared digital systems built upon minimal, modular digital building blocks that can be utilized by governments, businesses, academia, and civil society to facilitate society-wide development. 1 6. These platforms comprise open, secure, and interoperable systems that enable access to public and private services. Digital Identity, Payments, and Data Exchange form its foundational building blocks. 7. The G20 also established a comprehensive framework of guiding principles which underpin development and implementation of such platforms including, inclusivity to ensure universal access, interoperability for seamless system integration, scalability for large-scale deployment, security and privacy protection. II. Why Digital Public Platforms matter for central bankers – Economic Resilience as the driving force 8. Digital Public Platforms are of immense importance for Central Banks. 9. Central Banks not only serve as the ultimate guardians of economic resilience. They in many countries, are also responsible for enhancing financial inclusion and for operating and regulating critical payment and settlement infrastructure that form the backbone of modern economies. 10. Digital Public Platforms are an effective tool for achieving these objectives. They collectively lower barriers to inclusion and facilitate access to financial services. As a result, globally, around 865 million individuals opened their first account with financial institutions enabling quicker and hassle-free receipt of governmental grants and subvention 2 . 11. Development of fast payments systems (FPS) aligns with key public policy objectives, including creation of safe and efficient payment systems for everyone, reducing cash dependence, and supporting digitalisation. FPS continue to grow in both number and usage, having been established in more than 70 jurisdictions across the world. III. India as a case study in inclusive, secure, and scalable DPPs 12. India's Digital Public Platforms constitute a well-structured, multi-layered system of interconnected digital building blocks including digital identity through Aadhaar, instant payment systems via the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and secure data sharing through the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA). 13. For us, the guiding principle has been to build such platforms in the public sector as a public good with suitable guardrails, and without a profit motive. Public and private sector entities can then leverage on these platforms to quickly develop applications across credit, health, social protection, agriculture, and several other domains. 14. While the public sector establishes the foundational infrastructure layer, the success of Digital Public Platforms is bolstered by active private sector participation. Private sector engagement drives innovation and enhances competition, thereby elevating service quality and user experience. 15. Further, the private sector plays a vital role in innovating and nurturing vibrant developer communities and expanding digital markets. All of these contribute to the maturity of the ecosystem around the DPPs while maintaining the core principles of accessibility, inclusivity, and public benefit. 16. This approach has resulted in significant positive externalities for growth and development of digital payment systems in India. I will highlight a few initiatives taken by India to build such platforms. 17. I will start with Aadhaar, the unique identity platform. It is the very basic fundamental block for any digitalisation effort in a country. Aadhaar today has over 1.3 billion users. Using this identify platform, over 566 million bank accounts have been opened, 316 million of these belong to women. This has provided a significant fillip to financial inclusion initiatives. 18. It has also enabled direct benefit transfers (DBT) bypassing cash-based subsidy distribution and crediting subsidies directly into bank accounts. Over 500 billion USD have been transferred directly to beneficiaries, significantly reducing fraud and leakage. 19. Coming to payments, the Unified Payments Interface or UPI is another critical Digital Public Platform. It has transformed the payments landscape. It enables transfer of payments in real time, efficiently from one account to another across banks. 20. Around 85% of the digital payment transactions in India today are carried out through UPI. About 20 billion transactions are made using UPI every month, representing value equivalent to over 280 billion USD. 21. UPI is a powerful catalyst, accelerating financial inclusion. Small vendors and micro enterprises can now accept payments digitally, and build financial history, thereby enabling access to formal credit at much lower costs. 22. There are other benefits too. A recent research study on the impact of UPI suggests that higher UPI adoption is associated with lower cash demand 3 . Another study shows that a one percent increase in UPI transaction volumes correlates with a 0.03 percent increase in GDP growth 4 . 23. Digital payment systems have decreased delivery costs, minimised revenue leakages, and facilitated rapid deployment of emergency relief programmes, particularly during the global COVID-19 pandemic. IV. International Cooperation 24. We believe that the benefits of DPPs should be available to the whole world, in the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, which means, ‘the world is one family’. This was also the theme of India’s G20 presidency. We are fully committed to international collaboration around such platforms. 25. In the spirit of this collaboration, India developed the Modular Open-Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) 5 for digital identity. This free, secure, and scalable platform allows other countries to build their own national digital ID systems. 27 countries are currently either adopting or considering MOSIP-based systems, to deliver essential services quickly, directly, and seamlessly to their citizens. 26. For collaboration in digital payments, we have adopted three strategic approaches: (i) One, we are linking UPI with fast payment systems of other countries for cross-border remittances. Linkage between India and Singapore (UPI-PayNow) is live. Work is under progress with a few other countries bilaterally as well as multilaterally. (ii) Two, we are enabling cross-border merchant (P2M) payments through UPI via QR codes at merchant locations in both offline and e-commerce mode. This is already live in a few countries and work is in progress for enabling merchant payments in a few more countries. (iii) Three, we are supporting deployment of UPI-like sovereign payment rails or upgrading existing systems in partner countries using UPI technology stack, while agreement/MoU have been signed for deployment in a few more countries. 27. These efforts will also promote cross-border trade and payments, while encouraging efficiency, improving customer experience, and reducing cost. Concluding remarks 28. To conclude, Digital Public Platforms have proved to be central to inclusive growth in India. Their impact on welfare transfers, democratisation of payments and deepening of financial inclusion has, indeed, been transformative. We are committed to share our model to help countries accelerate digital transformation. I am confident that we can work together to empower our citizens through Digital Public Platforms.

      "summary": "Shri C S Setty, Chairman, State Bank of India, Mr Peter Simon, CEO and distinguished delegates of the WSBI, Shri Vinay Tonse, Managing Director, SBI and WSBI Asia Regional President, Friends, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, everyone! 2. At the outset, congratulations to WSBI for completion of a century, in bringing together savings and retail banks, from over 70 countries, representing the interests of customers of approximately 6,400 banks across all continents. As a global organisation, WSBI promotes a sustainable, inclusive and balanced growth and job creation around the world, with a clear focus on individual consumers, households and MSMEs. The members are main street players that are rooted strongly within the communities they serve, and support the local economies, with the shared values of being Retail, Regional and Responsible. I fondly recall my own association with WSBI during my time in SBI and I am thankful to SBI and WSBI for this kind invitation. 3. It is indeed a pleasure to welcome the WSBI delegation to India. During this study visit, I hope you will see how financial inclusion and digital innovation have evolved here through the interplay of public policy, regulatory oversight, and institutional initiatives. Along with recognising the challenges in India’s journey, I trust this visit will also provide space to reflect on how different approaches to inclusion and innovation can inform and enrich one another. 4. The idea I wish to underline today is that inclusion is innovation’s highest purpose . In India, financial inclusion has been pursued not as a single policy objective but as an ongoing national mission. Over the past decade, the Government, the Reserve Bank, and the banking sector have worked together to expand access to millions of households. The real task, however, lies in deepening usage, improving quality, and building lasting trust. 5. To capture progress along this journey, the Reserve Bank has developed a Financial Inclusion Index that tracks three dimensions—access, usage, and quality. 1 Over the years, there has been considerable progress made under the index. Five iterations of FI Index have been published till date, with March 2025 value standing perceptibly improved at 67.0 vis-à-vis 43.4 for the period ending March 2017. 2 Having said that, it is also an observation that, while access to financial services has improved significantly in recent years, the challenge now lies in promoting active usage and strengthening service quality. 6. Achieving this requires more than technology; it calls for products tailored to diverse needs and limitations, supported by human interfaces that build trust and confidence. ‘ Embedding empathy into service delivery ’ is a crucial step in ensuring that financial inclusion is meaningful and effective. 7. Equally important are transparent grievance redressal systems and clear consumer protection measures. Defined turnaround times, limited liability protections, and visible compensation frameworks reassure customers that they are safe in using digital services. Together, these measures foster confidence and encourage meaningful engagement with the financial system. Digital Public Infrastructure and India Stack 8. India’s strong digital public infrastructure underpins its financial inclusion efforts. At the centre of this architecture lies the India Stack —a set of interoperable, open, and scalable digital layers built as public goods. These include Aadhaar for digital identity, DigiLocker for secure digital storage and sharing of documents, and the Account Aggregator framework for consent-based data sharing. Together, they provide the rails on which a wide range of services can be delivered securely, at scale, and at an affordable cost. 9. Among these layers, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has emerged as the flagship success story. By integrating multiple accounts into a single mobile platform, UPI has revolutionised retail payments. 10. While UPI has rightly captured global attention, it represents only the most visible part of a much wider transformation. Behind it stands a comprehensive digital payments ecosystem that includes NEFT and RTGS for retail and high-value transfers, the Bharat Bill Payment System for interoperable bill payments, the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System for last-mile inclusion through micro-ATMs, and BharatQR for merchant acceptance. Together, these systems form a layered, resilient, and inclusive architecture. They ensure that digital transactions are not only fast and convenient but also secure, accessible, and trusted—cornerstones of India’s transition from a predominantly cash economy to a thriving digital one. 11. Building on this success, India is now developing the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), which seeks to bring the same principles of openness and interoperability to credit markets. Just as UPI made payments universal, ULI has the potential to mark a turning point in how affordable credit is accessed and delivered at scale. 12. Digital innovation is also extending inclusion beyond payments. Micro-insurance and pension products are increasingly being delivered through digital platforms, helping low-income households strengthen financial resilience. Cross-border UPI linkages are making remittances faster, cheaper, and more seamless, reinforcing trust in formal channels. RBI’s Role in Responsible Innovation 13. At the Reserve Bank, we seek to foster an environment where innovation can flourish responsibly. Through initiatives such as regulatory sandboxes, the Innovation Hub, and enabling frameworks for digital financial services, we encourage the development of new solutions that are secure, sustainable, and customer-centric. At the same time, we place due emphasis on governance, risk management, and customer protection, so that technological progress is always matched by resilience and trust in the financial system. 14. The rapid rise of fintechs, digital platforms, and embedded finance models has expanded the boundaries of the financial system and created new types of risks. These are not simply traditional risks in digital form, but new frontiers arising from algorithmic decision-making, heavy dependence on data, concentration of services in a few platforms, and deep technological interconnections. Left unmanaged, such risks can quickly migrate from individual institutions to the broader system. 15. This is why we encourage financial institutions to move to a proactive resilience mindset, embedding digital risk awareness and safeguards into their governance frameworks. Innovation and safety are not opposing goals; when balanced well, they reinforce each other and build lasting trust. Closing Reflections 16. As we look ahead, there is growing recognition worldwide that digital innovation is the most powerful driver of financial inclusion. India’s journey shows that access is only the first step—the true test lies in meaningful usage, in the quality of services, and in the trust that people place in the system. Innovations that do not embed responsibility can erode this trust, but when innovation and inclusion move together, they reinforce each other and create lasting transformation. 17. Allow me to return to the thought with which I began: inclusion is innovation’s highest purpose . As you reflect on India’s experience during this study visit, I hope you will see how collaboration between policy, regulation, and institutions can continue to widen the frontiers of inclusion. India’s journey shows that when innovation meets inclusion, transformation becomes inevitable . I hope this exchange inspires fresh ideas, new partnerships, and renewed resolve to make finance truly universal. Thank you. 1 The FI-Index has been conceptualised as a comprehensive index incorporating details of banking, investments, insurance, postal as well as the pension sector in consultation with Government and respective sectoral regulators. The index captures information on various aspects of financial inclusion in a single value ranging between 0 and 100, where 0 represents complete financial exclusion and 100 indicates full financial inclusion. The FI-Index comprises of three broad parameters (weights indicated in brackets) viz., Access (35%), Usage (45%), and Quality (20%) with each of these consisting of various dimensions, which are computed based on a number of indicators. It has been constructed without any ‘base year’ and as such it reflects cumulative efforts of all stakeholders over the years towards financial inclusion. 2 Reserve Bank of India introduces the Financial Inclusion Index",

      "summary": "I am very happy to participate in this 6th edition of the Global FinTech Fest (GFF). It is a premier forum where the wizards of technology intersect with the experts of finance. It is a unique forum where young innovators, brimming with bold ideas, converge with the steady wisdom of experienced leaders. This synergy which shapes solutions to common challenges reflects the true spirit of the GFF. This event also reflects India’s ambition to remain at the cutting edge of digital innovation. Over the years, the GFF has gained from strength to strength. I congratulate the organisers for this huge achievement. 2. In my remarks today, I wish to reflect on our Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and FinTech journey so far, the next phase of deepening and widening inclusion and sustainability, and the way ahead for FinTechs to translate these opportunities into tangible outcomes. DPI as the Engine for India’s Growth Story 3. DPI underpins India’s digital transformation over the last decade or so. It rests on three layers, that have played critical roles in addressing barriers to inclusion and enabling innovation at scale. 4. One, the identity layer, anchored by Aadhaar with more than 1.4 billion enrolments, has made it possible to authenticate identity instantly. It has also enabled millions to open bank accounts and participate in the formal financial system through electronic KYC. It is at the core of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for government benefits. 5. Two, the payments layer which translates identity into action. Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) has enabled banking through micro-ATMs and facilitated access even in remote locations. Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has allowed close to 490 million unique users to make nearly 20 billion transactions every month, almost half of the global real-time payment volumes. 6. Three, the data layer has reshaped how financial services are delivered. Take any government department, for instance. There is a tremendous amount of digitalisation that has happened in each department. I was in the Revenue Department earlier. With almost all income data now digitised, filing an income tax return in India takes only a few minutes. On average, returns are processed in 10 days and many taxpayers receive their refunds within 24 hours. We are among the world leaders in tax filing and processing systems. 7. Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is a unique model with no parallel in the world. 28 states, 8 UTs and the centre – all with a different GST statute passed by different legislatures, but still the same except the name of the state. This unification of GST has been possible because of the backbone provided by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN). All this has created a lot of digital data comprising the data layer . Further, DigiLocker with over 590 million users, has enabled citizens to store and share documents securely in a digital form. FinTech complementing the DPI 8. Complimenting these three layers of DPI, we have a vibrant FinTech ecosystem. The foundation of DPI allows FinTechs to set up quickly, scale rapidly, and deliver targeted solutions to not only address current but also future challenges. India is today home to over 10,000 FinTech companies, with cumulative investments exceeding USD 40 billion over the past decade. 9. The sector’s phenomenal growth and future potential is underpinned by several key strengths, apart from the robust DPI. These include a large and deep pool of skilled technology talent, a vibrant financial ecosystem spanning payments, lending, insurance, pensions, wealth management, etc. which is supporting FinTech innovation, and enabling policies and regulatory frameworks which are facilitating FinTechs. 10. Regular engagement with the FinTech ecosystem is central to this approach. RBI has been proactive in engaging with the FinTech sector, as is borne out by nearly 500 interactions with FinTech entities during FY 2024-25 alone. In addition, through structured platforms such as FinTeract and Finquiry, we interact regularly with innovators and entrepreneurs in the FinTech ecosystem. Since March 2024, we have conducted 15 structured sessions under Finteract , covering over 1,100 FinTech representatives. In addition, 14 open interactions with more than 600 participants have been held under Finquiry since June 2024. 11. The Reserve Bank has also established a FinTech Repository to collect key information on activities, products, and technologies, enabling more informed and evidence-based policymaking for the FinTech sector. 12. Recognising the diversity in the FinTech Sector, we have, so far, granted recognition to a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) in the FinTech Sector. This will enable FinTechs which are not directly regulated to operate within a calibrated framework with baseline governance standards and best practices developed by the industry itself. 13. Over the past decade, India has shown how technology, thoughtfully designed and implemented at scale, can be a force multiplier for sustainable economic development. The FinTech industry, has made it possible to deliver financial services at population scale, at an affordable cost. We will continue the facilitation for FinTechs to make use of the DPI and financial ecosystem for the collective benefit of the economy. This synergy between public rails and private innovation, has been the bedrock of India’s success in several domains, including digitalisation of payments. The Next Phase of India’s Digital Journey 14. The first phase of India’s digital journey was about building the foundation and expanding access to financial services such as savings, insurance, investments. The next phase is about universalising and deepening impact by using data responsibly. I will talk about five areas. Some work has been done in all these areas but more needs to be done. These are: (a) aggregation and leveraging financial data; (b) the digital rupee; (c) asset tokenisation; (d) artificial intelligence; and (e) digital frauds. Aggregation and Leveraging Financial Data Ac count Aggregator (AA) 15. First, we need to develop DPI for data integration across various data sources to widen and deepen financial inclusion. The Account Aggregator (AA) framework is one such endeavour. It is empowering individuals to share their financial data safely with regulated entities. This ecosystem has seen notable progress with 17 AAs, 650 Financial Information Users (FIUs), 150 Financial Information Providers (FIPs), 160 million accounts being served, and 3.66 billion data requests from FIUs processed by AAs. Many important government owned data sources like the GSTN have been included in the AA framework. 16. On its part, the RBI is in the process of introducing standards designed to improve customer onboarding processes, enhance user interfaces, strengthen data security, and increase transparency in consent management and data sharing under the AA framework. 17. While there is huge potential for the AA framework to grow, its success will depend on two critical aspects, namely, integration with more financial information, especially information which is vital for assessing the financial status of an individual, and interoperability across account aggregators. ULI 18. The Unified Lending Interface (ULI) is another landmark step in data aggregation. Credit remains the lifeblood of inclusive growth. Despite best efforts by the Government, RBI, and the banking system, and huge progress made in this regard, a vast credit gap still persists. The ULI seeks to bridge the gap by enabling efficient, data-driven, and inclusive credit delivery. 19. Since its launch in August 2023 till October 03, 2025, the ULI pilot has now expanded to 120 data sources/services, 58 lenders including banks, NBFCs, co-operative banks with 3.2 million loans sanctioned and ₹1.75 trillion in lending. The ULI is also enabling use of data by lenders to build alternative credit models, thereby helping expand credit to new-to-credit segments lacking credit history. Digital Rupee (e₹) 20. Second, India’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Digital Rupee (e₹) represents a critical new rail in the DPI architecture. Since its launch in December 2022, the retail e₹ pilot today has 19 banks and 7 million users, enabling person-to-person (P2P) as well as person-to-merchant (P2M) transactions. Interoperability with UPI is also enabling wider adoption of the e₹ without compromising user convenience. 21. Programmability features in e₹ are unlocking new paradigms in purpose-driven direct benefit transfers, subsidies, and targeted lending. These features have been leveraged by some state governments demonstrating the potential for making subsidy delivery and DBT more effective. For instance, Gujarat’s G-SAFAL scheme uses programmable CBDC (p-CBDC) to provide livelihood assistance, allowing beneficiaries to spend subsidies only on whitelisted agri-inputs within a geofenced area. Similarly, Andhra Pradesh’s DEEPAM 2.0 scheme provides LPG subsidies through p-CBDC, which is redeemed on delivery of gas cylinders by the registered gas agencies. Asset Tokenisation 22. Third, asset tokenisation offers new possibilities for Indian financial markets in expanding access, improving transparency, and enhancing settlement efficiency through smart contracts. 23. I am happy to announce that the Reserve Bank has conceptualised the Unified Markets Interface (UMI), as a next-generation financial market infrastructure. UMI will have the capability to tokenise financial assets and settlements using wholesale CBDC. Early results from the inaugural pilot on the issuance of Certificate of Deposit, in improving market efficiency are encouraging. Artificial Intelligence 24. Fourth, AI holds the potential to fundamentally enhance the next generation of DPI in two complementary ways. First, by integrating AI into existing DPI layers, user experience and efficiency can be significantly improved. For example, conversational payments can simplify transactions for users with low digital literacy and bring millions into the formal economy. Second, AI itself can be developed as a public goods infrastructure. 25. The report of the FREE-AI committee constituted by RBI has also highlighted the importance of building foundational public goods for AI in finance, including a standardised financial sector data infrastructure, compute resources, and the development of indigenous AI models, tailored to the needs of the financial system. Digital Frauds 26. Fifth, the rapid expansion of digital finance has also created new challenges such as digital frauds and cyber threats. The Reserve Bank has instituted several customer protection measures, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), tokenisation of card on file, and providing customers with the control to switch off transactions to secure digital transactions. 27. The recently announced principle-based framework on authentication of digital transactions will provide further impetus to enhancing consumer convenience while strengthening trust in digital transactions. Exclusive internet domains, ‘. bank.in’ and ‘. fin.in’, for banks and financial institutions, and designated numbering series, i.e., ‘1600xx’ for transactional and service calls, and ‘140xx’ for promotional communications by regulated entities, are other initiatives to enhance security and public trust in digital transactions. 28. MuleHunter.ai, developed by the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub has been scaled up from about 5 banks at the beginning of this year to 21 banks. Unlike earlier approaches, this is enabling them to use system-wide learning to improve detection of mule accounts. Work is also underway on the Digital Payments Intelligence Platform (DPIP), which will leverage latest technologies to provide shared intelligence for fraud detection and prevention in near-real time. 29. These measures will enhance customer safety and trust in digital payments. We all need to redouble our efforts to keep our systems safe, secure and fraud proof. Conclusion 30. We stand at an important juncture in our digital finance journey. The past decade has demonstrated how technology can expand access and empower businesses. The next phase must build on this strong foundation, while keeping trust and stability at its central theme. The role of FinTechs in this next phase will be even more crucial. FinTechs can be the architects who design and construct digital highways and also the products and services on this digital highway that generate social and economic value. 31. I would like to leave five thoughts for the FinTech industry to consider. One, build for Inclusion: while there may be higher profits to be made by deepening access to the haves and the privileged, prioritise building systems to expand financial services to the unaccessed, unreached and unserved segments of society. Two, adopt customer-first approach: As Steve Jobs said, “Get closer than ever to your customers. So close that you tell them what they need well before they realize it themselves”. Design products and services that are easy to use and accessible for all, with assistive technologies ensuring vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, individuals with limited digital literacy, and the specially abled are not left behind. As I have said at other fora, strive to design services so well that there is no need for customer service in the first place. Three, innovate in credit delivery: Extend the success of digital payments to credit delivery, especially to small businesses and individuals. Four, prioritise trust and compliance: Embed strong data protection, transparency, and safeguards for consumers into every product and service. Five, think global, anchor local: Engage with international partners, share learnings, adopt global best practices, and strengthen India’s role in shaping the future of digital finance. 32. By embracing these principles and building on India’s unique strengths of DPI, a vibrant ecosystem, a digitally connected population, enabling policies, and tech talent, FinTechs can bridge digital divides, foster healthy competition, and drive innovation. 33. In doing so, FinTechs will not only secure their own growth but also play a pivotal role in driving progress and contributing to the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. 34. In this hall, we have people with both the foresight and the capability to act. Let us harness this opportunity and together shape a shared future of inclusive, sustainable, and innovation-driven growth. Thank you. Jai Hind.",

      "summary": "Good afternoon, distinguished policymakers, members of academia, industry leaders and innovators. It is both a pleasure and a responsibility to address this gathering on a subject that is poised to shape the future of finance, society, and governance alike—Responsible Artificial Intelligence. AI has rapidly evolved from an academic discussion less than a decade back to become an integral part of our daily lives. We encounter it when we unlock our phones, interact with chatbots, and increasingly, when accessing financial services. In just a few years, AI has evolved from an enabling technology to a foundational driver of how individuals and businesses make decisions. Globally, AI is already reshaping financial systems. From digital credit underwriting to conversational banking assistants, AI is demonstrating its ability in ways unimaginable a decade ago. India, too, has been a notable participant in this journey. Yet, as with all powerful innovations, AI carries a dual narrative. It promises extraordinary efficiency, inclusion, and innovation, but if left unattended, could pose unprecedented threats. As Stephen Hawking said in 2016 at the launch of the Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI), “the rise of powerful AI will either be the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity. We do not yet know which.” It is acknowledged widely that AI could be the permanent answer to poverty and disease. But equally there have been concerns from AI experts – ranging from concern around bad actors using AI for bad things to the more fundamental concern that human existence is irrelevant once machines achieve superintelligence. I do not intend to dwell on these widely divergent possibilities but only to highlight the limited point that while the benefits of AI are transformative, they need to be used responsibly. In finance, the margin for error is even narrower as financial institutions are built on trust and economies prosper on stability. Therefore, the integration of AI in financial systems must be approached as a matter of profound responsibility with due recognition and mitigation of risks. AI for the Financial Sector The Benefits The promise of Artificial Intelligence in finance is by now well recognised. At its core, AI can expand financial access, strengthen safeguards, and reimagine efficiency. It can lead to better credit assessment through use of alternative data (like transaction patterns, utility payments, etc.) of unbanked customers. Ability to use massive data sources could help in real-time detection of frauds through identification of unusual transaction patterns, or improve market risk modeling. Operational efficiency and cost reduction can get a paradigm shift using AI, e.g., in back-office processes, KYC, loan processing etc. Chatbots and virtual assistants would achieve 24x7 customer support. Data extraction from financial documents (e.g., invoices, contracts) through Natural Language Processing (NLP) could make document processing seamless. In the investment and trading space, the ability of AI models to detect short-term price inefficiencies are already being harnessed. Other benefits include allocation optimisation, use of big data to forecast market movements etc. AI driven RegTech applications help regulated entities with better compliance outcomes. Automated monitoring helps detection of suspicious transactions and generates faster compliance. AI has the potential to significantly expedite financial inclusion through alternative credit scoring models while language interfaces will remove language barriers and reach digitally limited customers. Investment advice becomes affordable to small investors through robo-advisors. The Risks But these benefits come with significant risks. AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data. It is natural that the learning from the data would also extend to learning the bias inherent in data. AI systems trained on biased historical data are likely to perpetuate or amplify historical discrimination in, for example, credit profiling, or hiring. Even small biases in training data can lead to systematic exclusion of population groups from accessing financial services. Algorithmic opacity would make it difficult to identify possible biases. The ‘Black Box’ problem of AI models, or, in other words, the lack of explainability, makes these models non-transparent. This makes it hard for regulators and auditors to understand how decisions are made, which, in turn, undermines accountability. Regulatory actions, or denial of service to customers, would typically require reasons to be communicated. Absence of explainability may thus constrain the use of such tools. There are systemic risks typical to AI systems, such as herding behaviour when AI-driven trading models get widely used, which can amplify volatility. AI misjudgments can trigger market dislocations. Such problems are amplified by the possibility that it becomes difficult to assign responsibility when an AI makes a harmful or erroneous decision. Legal frameworks would always find it difficult to catch up with fast moving technology. Over-reliance on automation could result in losing oversight or delayed intervention when things go wrong. There is also the ethical issue of using behavioral data for manipulative cross-selling or risk profiling. Then there is the ongoing debate about AI and job displacement. Whether AI will displace jobs in the long run would depend on whether it is like other transformative changes in history like the Industrial Revolution or the invention of electricity or whether it is a fundamentally different kind of change. Max Tegmark, founder of Future of Life Institute argues that while all past technologies amplified human ability but did not replace human intelligence, AI is the first technology that creates intelligence itself. Recognizing these risks is not to diminish the promise of AI, but to underline the importance of adopting it responsibly through safeguards, governance, and foresight. Balancing Innovation with Stability The key question is, how do we enable innovation while safeguarding systemic stability? This balance is a necessity for ensuring that AI strengthens rather than undermines the financial system. If regulatory frameworks are too rigid, they can dissuade experimentation, reducing AI to a tool deployed only by the largest players. On the other side, unbridled adoption, particularly in high-impact areas, could create vulnerabilities that are invisible until they snowball into crises. The balance is not only about restraint; it is also about actively encouraging innovation. This requires policies that create safe spaces for experimentation, such as sandboxes, facilitate open digital infrastructures, and provide access to quality data, enabling firms to innovate with confidence. It also requires incentives for responsible innovation, so that firms see governance not as a burden but as a competitive advantage. Responsible AI – Guiding Principles As we reflect on the transformative potential of AI, it becomes imperative to anchor its adoption within a framework of principles. The RBI took a proactive step through setting up the FREE-AI Committee, which has articulated a set of guiding sutras for responsible and ethical adoption of AI in the financial sector. These principles are intended to serve as touchstones for all stakeholders. At the core is the principle of trust, the bedrock of finance. Every deployment of AI must reinforce, not diminish, the trust of consumers, institutions, and society. Equally important is a people-first orientation, ensuring that technology serves human needs. The report emphasizes innovation over restraint, coupled with fairness and accountability in outcomes. AI can inform decisions, but it cannot own them. The accountability must always rest with human actors and institutions deploying AI. The principle of ‘understandable by design’ underscores the need for transparency, ensuring that AI decisions are explainable to both regulators and consumers. And above all, safety and resilience must be built into every layer of adoption. Alongside regulatory oversight, it is equally critical to encourage industry-led codes of conduct, self-regulation, and the institutionalisation of ethical standards. This collaborative approach ensures that responsibility is not a mandate of regulators but a shared culture across the fintech ecosystem. RBI’s Approach and Role The RBI has always fostered “innovation within safeguards.” Through calibrated guidance, supervisory oversight, and structured engagement with industry, the RBI aims to foster an ecosystem where financial innovation flourishes without compromising systemic stability. As AI reshapes the financial landscape, this approach remains unchanged - progress and prudence must go hand in hand. RBI has also taken initiatives for the industry through RBIH, such as MuleHunter.ai™ for combating the menace of mule accounts. Unlike the traditional rule-based systems currently used by banks, MuleHunter.ai™ offers greater accuracy and precision with significantly low false positive rates. Currently, the model has been deployed in about 20 commercial banks. In addition, work is also underway to explore a Digital Payments Intelligence Platform (DPIP), that can analyse and assign a risk score to transactions on a real time basis. Ringfencing and Guardrails While AI holds immense promise, the financial system demands the highest degree of prudence. Critical infrastructures and institutions must be ringfenced from unchecked risks that could arise from untested or poorly governed AI deployments. The objective is not to obstruct innovation but to ensure that its application never compromises the stability or integrity of the system. To this end, practices such as stress-testing of AI models under diverse scenarios, red-teaming to identify vulnerabilities, and the adoption of explainability tools and standards are indispensable. These mechanisms would help regulators and institutions alike to supervise AI outcomes, detect weaknesses before they escalate, and ensure that AI-driven decisioning can be understood and, if necessary, challenged. Equally important is that AI systems are subjected to rigorous oversight and layered with inherent checks. Financial AI applications must be designed such that they cannot inadvertently destabilize markets, payment systems, or consumer confidence. This approach demands “safety by design” rather “safety as an afterthought.” Safeguards must be embedded throughout the lifecycle, from conception and data training to model validation and real-world application. Retrofitting safety once risks have materialized is inadequate and potentially destabilizing. Research, Innovation, and Collaboration Embedding AI in finance is not a one-time exercise. It demands continuous research, experimentation, and learning, as models, techniques and risks evolve rapidly. It also calls for partnerships among industry, academia, regulators, and start-ups. Co-developing solutions, sharing knowledge, and stress-testing innovations must be fostered. Entities should have in place systems for responsible data governance, ethical sourcing of data, and privacy-by-design in every model. They should develop common standards, toolkits, and disclosure mechanisms so that model design, training data, and decision logic can be explained to regulators and customers. Safeguards such as digital watermarking of synthetic content should be explored to deter misuse. Internal policies and processes must be revised to embed AI risk assessment into the product lifecycle. Continuous monitoring, stress scenarios, and independent audits should be institutionalised. The Way Forward As we look ahead, the path for responsible AI in India’s financial sector is exciting yet deliberate, demanding a phased approach that balances innovation, inclusion and stability. Alongside technological progress, the human element remains central. AI literacy for consumers to understand both the potential and risks of AI will be critical. Just as financial literacy has been a national priority, the coming decade will require a parallel focus on AI literacy, for individuals to engage confidently and safely with these new tools. In the short term, the focus needs to be on awareness and capacity building. Financial institutions, technology providers, and regulators must train personnel, strengthen internal governance structures, and introduce initial risk frameworks to ensure that AI deployment is encouraged with focus on safety. Awareness campaigns and workshops can also help smaller institutions and FinTechs integrate AI responsibly. In the medium term, the FREE-AI principles should guide the industry practice. AI can begin to play a substantial role in SupTech, credit decisioning, and financial inclusion. In parallel, the industry should develop its own governance standards, self-regulatory codes, and ethical guidelines to complement regulatory oversight. In the long term, India can aspire to become a trusted global hub for responsible AI in finance. By demonstrating how innovation can coexist with strong safeguards, India can set an example for emerging economies and the Global South, attracting talent, investment, and collaboration. Concluding Remarks As we conclude, it is essential to reiterate that AI must remain a force for good - empowering individuals, strengthening institutions, and enhancing the resilience of our financial system. Its promise will be realised only when adopted responsibly, with constant attention to societal impact. Responsible AI should not be framed merely as a regulatory requirement, but as a matter of business ethics. Every model deployed, every decision automated, and every service enabled through AI must reinforce the confidence of consumers, provide fair access, and respect the dignity and privacy of all participants. Let me leave you with five guideposts. Not as tasks, but as a collective mission: the 5Ts Trust – Commit to building AI systems that uphold and enhance the trust in the system. Embed responsibility and ethics in every algorithm. Transparency – Reinforce clarity and explainability in AI, ensuring that decisions can be understood, audited, and questioned when necessary. Training – Invest in training to nurture a world-class AI talent within our financial ecosystem. Ensure India leads in creating, not just consuming. Technology for Good – Let innovation be guided by purpose. The test of every AI application must be whether it advances inclusion, resilience, and efficiency. Togetherness – Above all, we must work together. Regulators, industry, academia, and global partners, to collaborate and co-develop. Through shared commitment, ethical deployment, and continuous vigilance, we can ensure that AI fulfils its promise as a transformative enabler. 1 Keynote address delivered by Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar at the Global Fintech Festival, Mumbai on October 7th, 2025",

Rabi Sankar – Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Shri Swaminathan J – Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Dr. Poonam Gupta – Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya – Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India Dr. Ajit Joshi – Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India Moderator: Shri Puneet Pancholy – Chief General Manager, Reserve Bank of India Puneet Pancholy: Hello, and good afternoon. Welcome to this Post Policy Press Conference, fourth for the financial year 2025-26. Friends, we have with us Governor, Reserve Bank of India, Shri Sanjay Malhotra; Deputy Governors, Shri M. Rajeshwar Rao; Shri T. Rabi Sankar; Shri Swaminathan J; and Dr. Poonam Gupta. We also have with us Executive Directors, Dr. Ajit Joshi, and for the first time Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya. I also welcome my other colleagues from the Reserve Bank. As always, we will have a few housekeeping announcements. Sir, there are around 23 participants from the media. And I request the media participants to please stick to one question so that everybody gets a chance. I would also request everyone to switch on the mic when they are intervening, so that the people listening to this transmission, they are able to listen clearly. And once you are done, please switch it off. Sir, so with your permission, I will call out the names. I would ask Ms. Latha Venkatesh from CNBC TV-18, to ask the first question. Latha, please. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Thank you, Puneet. And thank you, Governor, for the opportunity. You have said in the statement that the fall in inflation opens up space for further supporting growth. You have omitted the word limited, which was there previously when you said limited space. So, should we understand there is space for more than one cut? And what is the trigger? If you had the space, why not now? What trigger are you waiting for? You also said that the transmission is broad based. Are you okay with the way bond yields have moved? There doesn't seem to be transmission there. Sanjay Malhotra: Yes, there is a change as you have noticed. I mean, inflation has reduced considerably since we met earlier in June by 1% and so that does open up the space. At the same time, growth you have seen while it has surprised us on the upside in Q1, Q3, Q4 and even next year, there is a downward revision slightly. And as mentioned, it is on account of the tariff, the 50% tariff that has come into play, offset to some extent by the GST. Why not a rate cut, is again, you know, given in our Statement, monetary policy transmission, while it has been good across sectors, it is still happening. And it is not only monetary policy transmission, there are other policies, for example, the Government’s GST rate and a number of other policies announced by the Hon’ble PM and the Government. They are taking shape, and their impact is still unfolding. At the same time, there are still a lot of uncertainties. We see developments every week, every day. And we also see responses there too. There is still clarity on that account. And so that is why the MPC felt that we should pause. Insofar as transmission to government bonds is concerned, you are aware that there was a good transmission of about from 6.86 peaks, or thereabout to 6.30, about 46 basis points. And after that there has been a hardening. So, the net impact thereof is only about 26, 6.59 today, so about 30 basis points. More than 30 basis points, yes, about 30 or less than 30 basis points in the government yields. We are watchful, and we will see, you know, how ultimately it is of course, you know, for the demand and supply. We will see how all the needs of the economy are supported. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Speak about limited. Why did you drop that word? Sanjay Malhotra: I mentioned, no, that inflation has dropped by 1% from our earlier forecast. It is now at 2.6% from our earlier forecast. So, it has dropped down by 1% and so that is why that's the reason. And the growth at the same time, I did mention, has also been revised slightly downwards primarily, of course, you know, as I mentioned, on account of trade-related, the higher tariff that has come into play, which is still negotiations going on, etc., still unfolding. But we have taken that. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Space to cut. Limited space? Sanjay Malhotra: We have made that change. And that's the reason. The changing growth inflation dynamics is the reason that we have changed the language. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. For the next question, I will ask Mr. Mayur Shetty from Times of India. Mayur, please. Mayur Shetty, Times of India: Sir, since the last policy there has been a lot of headwinds from the United States, there has been tariff notice, and the H1B Visa and the US Commerce Secretary has also been talking about the need to ‘fix India’. You have made some adjustments to the growth forecast and what exactly does it mean for the financial market? And just the GST reforms and deregulations you mentioned are they enough to offset the US impact? Sanjay Malhotra: That is the attempt that whatever are the external headwinds, we try to counter them. Ours is primarily a domestic demand-driven economy, so the impact is limited. It is not as high as some of the other countries, as I had earlier mentioned. And the government, as well as the RBI, both fiscal, monetary, and other policies, we will make all efforts to ensure that whatever are the headwinds, they can be countered. At the same time, you are aware that negotiations are still going on. Government is looking at other means, opening up other markets. There has already been a trade deal with the UK. Negotiations are on with so many other countries including Oman, EU, etc. that will also open up markets for our exporters. And on the whole, the growth, Indian growth has been quite resilient, and we are very hopeful that we will continue to maintain a very high growth trajectory while maintaining price stability. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, I will have Mr. Manojit Saha from Business Standard. Manojit, please. Manojit Saha, Business Standard: Thank you, Governor. The commentary is that inflation is coming down while there is softening of the bond yields because of the trade related uncertainties. I wanted to understand, so this clearly hints that going ahead rates can probably come down. Rates going up is not an option. So, is there a discussion to change the stance to accommodative? Sanjay Malhotra: Yes, there was a discussion as you have already noted. Two members wanted. You do not have a vote. It is more of a forward guidance. Let me again clarify. This was clarified in one of the earlier policies. It has got nothing to do with liquidity. It is only as a measure of forward guidance as to where the rates can be going forward. So, two members, Professor Ram Singh and Dr. Nagesh Kumar, wanted, (and) have given their guidance as accommodative, while the others have maintained it at neutral. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Ms. Hamsini from Moneycontrol. Hamsini, please. Hamsini Karthik, Moneycontrol: Thank you. Good afternoon, Governor. I will add a little from macro aspects. One of the things in the policy speech which sort of caught my attention a lot was the limits for specified large corporates. That has been sort of done away with and the reason in 2016 it was introduced, one of the reasons cited was to also develop a very vibrant bond market and derisk the banking sector to some extent. So, now that we have gone back on that, what is the inference that one should make that credit growth for large corporates should once again come back or be fed by banks? Or despite all efforts to create a little bit of vibrancy in bond markets, it is not yet picking up. How should we infer that particular change, sir? And as a continuation to that, a lot of changes have also come pro-banking sector in this particular speech. Like, for instance, funding acquisitions, etc. What was the rationale in making or in opening the doors for ease of doing business for banks, granting a lot of their wants? Sanjay Malhotra: A lot of questions in one question only. First of all, my understanding is that the 2016 Policy was more about mitigating risk and reducing, limiting exposure to large corporates at the banking system level, not at the bank level. For the bank level, I would like to clarify that the large exposure framework which was there continues. There is no change at the bank level, individual bank level, whatever is the large exposure framework continues. The banking system level, any borrower which was having an exposure, a credit limit of ₹10,000 crore or more from 2019 onwards, this limit was progressively reduced from 25 to 15 to 10,000 starting from 2016 to 2019. That has been done away because it is felt that the large exposure framework is able to take care of the needs at the individual bank level and at the banking system level, if there is a need, we have the macroprudential tools already to take care of that. Thirdly, you have been seeing that the share of corporates in total banking exposure has in fact come down over the years. I do not have the right numbers. I think last 10 years, it has reduced by about 10% or so. So, the risks are not so many. So, that is the primary reason why we have reduced, why we have proposed to remove this large exposure framework for specific borrowers at the banking system level. And then there are a number of other measures, ease of doing business. I think we announced seven measures on top of some five measures, smaller measures which we had announced a few days, couple of days ago. That is a continuous process. We need to continue looking at rationalising our regulations so that the productive needs of the economy are met with the least of compliance burden, with the least of cost, while at the same time, ensuring that wherever prudential measures are required, they are not compromised. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now, I would like to request Mr. Anurag Shah from ET Now Swadesh to ask his question. Mr. Anurag. Anurag Shah, ET Now Swadesh: Thank you Mr. Puneet. Sir, you talked about GST reform at the beginning of your statement and at the end as well. So, sir, the target of growth which has been revised, what is the contribution of tariff in that and what is the contribution of GST reform? Because this reform has started from the September 22. So, in the future, there can be more change in the outlook of growth. And the inflation which you have brought from 3.1% to 2.6%, the GST reform which was announced by the government and before that in the budget, which was announced in the personal income tax, after both of these, people will get a lot of money and it will go into consumption. So, how much impact will it have on inflation? I had asked a question last time, but I could not ask it correctly. So, if you allow me, can I ask it later? Sanjay Malhotra: So, first, what you have said, the impact of all this, whether it is GST, whether it is 50% tariff, in the baseline we have considered baseline tariff as 50% in all our estimates. So, but as it was said in the statement, as far as growth rate is concerned, the 50% tariff and along with that the uncertainty, the global demand, it has two impacts. One is the global demand, not only US demand, but on the whole global demand, there will be a reduction. There is an impact due to which, as you know, 20 basis points, before that we had 6.7% to 6.5% and now the impact of 50% is on direct exports in the US which can be reduced if the current talks that are going on yield constructive results and the impact of GST will be less than that. So, it will not be able to offset completely. In total, as we said, there is a reduction of 20 basis points and all these impacts, we have assumed this assumption. In total, however in this year because in the first 6 months, there has been good economic activity and the numbers have already come to us, so in total, the growth forecast for this year has increased. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. If you get time, ask later. Everyone else should get a chance. Thank you, sir. Next, I will request Ms. Swati Bhat from Reuters. Swati Bhat, Reuters: Thank you, sir. So, at the RBI for the last decade or so, largely the focus has been on reducing the banking sector risks, but now by easing the large exposure framework, allowing banks to fund acquisitions, IPO financing, more in shares, aren’t you in some way making, inviting possible risks here? I mean, and what are we trying to achieve through all this easing? Can you just throw some light on that? Thank you. Sanjay Malhotra: We have taken measures, very balanced, calibrated, thought out, considered, even though we will still be doing a public consultation, even pre the formal consultation, a number of consultations, and there are measures on both sides. There are at least a couple of them, ECL, credit risk related capital adequacy norms, which I would not say would put higher requirement, I do not think so, but it will be better targeted. Those banks, depending on the risks, some of them may have to provide and keep higher credit, it will be better targeted. And similarly, some of the other measures that we have taken to enhance the flow of credit, improve the competitiveness of the banks. It is not as if those measures were not there at all. For example, acquisition finance was already allowed for infrastructure companies and now we have expanded it. Similarly, the loans against shares, etc. or for IPO financing, it was already there. It was not revised for a number of years. It is but natural that we revise them. I think on the whole, all these measures taken together and we will continue to take more measures as and when required. Always the aim will be to promote the stability while at the same time, improving competitiveness, encouraging and enhancing growth of the economy. Do you want to come in? M. Rajeshwar Rao: Sir, I think as Governor has already mentioned. Sanjay Malhotra: Because number of measures actually, pertain to regulation division, I will request DG MRR to… M. Rajeshwar Rao: I think most of the measures have been well thought out and calibrated, one. Second, the banking system's ability to handle the risks has improved over the period. So, there is some enough provisions. Third, most of the measures have enough guardrails built into them to safeguard the interests of the banks and the financial system. And speaking of the loans against shares, I think while the limit has gone from ₹20 lakhs to ₹1 crore, I think the limits were last revised in 1998. So, inflation itself, if you factor it in, it is not really a very significant increase. So, overall, I think it has been a calibrated set of measures and again, it is coming up for public consultation. So, we will take the feedback and revise it, if appropriately required. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sirs. Next, we will have Mr. Vishwanath Nair from NDTV Profit. Vishwanath Nair, NDTV Profit: Good afternoon, Governor. I will go back to your first speech as RBI Governor where you spoke about the cost of regulation and the ease of regulation. Are we to see these 22 guidelines that or whatever indications of guidelines that you have listed out in today's speech as a move towards that? Because while ECL is a very necessary and very delayed sort of framework that is coming in, a lot of others seem to be giving banks whatever they were asking for, some of it. Like, for example, acquisition financing or something else, banks have been speaking very vocally about it in the last few weeks. Is that how we should see these moves? Sanjay Malhotra: Yes, see, circumstances change, times change, requirements change and so nothing should be frozen in time. And so, that is why we had earlier also said that we will be continuously reviewing our regulations. In fact, we have decided in the FSDC under the chairmanship of the Finance Minister where all the finance sector regulators come together to review each and every regulation every 5 to 7 years. So, while we are doing that and while it will be a continuous process as you are mentioning, some of these things which have come our way, we have thought it appropriate to revise them and it is very important that we continuously revise, review, improve our whole regulatory ecosystem. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Anup Roy from Bloomberg. Anup Roy, Bloomberg: Thank you, sir. Sir, in the policy you mentioned about rupee reference rate with trading partners, now with major trading partners, so far we have four-rupee reference rate and now it will be expanded. So, what are those currencies and also, I wonder what will be the benchmark reference rate that you will use and will that also increase rupee’s trading in the international market? Like, what I mean is that earlier there used to be a cross-currency like INR-USD and then say, USD-CNY. How will you fix that? T. Rabi Sankar: Yes, I think the objective is that you minimise the use of crossing currencies to get rates. Now, that will help both our currency as well as the other currency. We are currently looking at a couple of currencies. We are looking at Indonesian Rupiah as one, we are looking at AED (UAE Dirham) for another, but there are a few others. We will gradually keep taking them up. About your question on how do we set the benchmark, we will have to see. We will have to see because there are not many active transactions to begin with. So, FBIL has to work out - what is the best way of initiating something. This is a case where the pricing, the reference has to be shown first, and the market has to pick up from there. So, keeping that in mind, we will have to work out ways of how do we arrive at, what benchmarks do we use for these reference rates. Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now I will invite Ms. Ekta Suri from Zee Business to ask her question. Ekta Suri, Zee Business: Good afternoon, sir. My question is related with common people and their pocket. I would like to ask that since the time of last policy to this policy, 2-3 news have made headlines. The first one is that according to banking sector, the way UPI transactions are increasing there is a burden on our infrastructure, but the cost is not yet being recovered. So, is it that in coming days will there be some fees on the UPI big transactions. And the second news is that the banking sector is saying that if the house is on mortgage in home loan with us or gold is mortgaged in gold loan then if we talk about the smart appliances like smart phones, then there is no possibility of recovery. Then in this case, can the bank go back on old ways where the phone gets locked if you do not pay EMI. Also, the way the valid handle of SEBI is launched in which if I am paying money to a fraud then I will get to know that this is fraud and not registered under SEBI. So, if there is any platform in which if I am transferring money then I will get to know that this is a fraud account or I am getting stuck in it… Sanjay Malhotra: Three questions. First one is if any charges are going to be levied on UPI. We have no such proposal in front of us. Second you said that if the mobile phone loan is given to purchase it, then can we give permission to lock it or not, the way it is given for auto loans etc. This case is under study. We are getting responses from both sides. We are taking cognisance of the same. Our effort is that our consumers’ rights and data privacy should be protected. Consumer interest and their wellbeing is the top most priority and at the same time how can we protect the lenders’ interest as well - that matter is still under study. Your third question was about fraud, which is a very serious matter, and we have taken a lot of steps toward that. It is our continuous endeavor to find a way to stop the money transfer from one account to another in a fraudulent manner. On the same way we have told you about MuleHunter and in similar way we are now doing another experiment; we have not implemented it completely. We are preparing software to gather all the information at the beginning of the transaction so that we can warn our consumers that this is a risky transaction - do not proceed with this transaction we are trying for that. I would ask our DG to explain the same thing in English. And regarding your second question regarding mobile phone, I would ask DG MRR to translate it in English. T Rabi Sankar: No, I will not try to translate what the Governor said, but yes, it is basically this. The digital payments intelligence platform - you would recall that RBI had set up a group, it had announced. We are now implementing it. As the Governor said, the actual prototype is getting developed by our Innovation Hub. An entity is being set up to run this. The basic idea behind this platform is that you collect information from whatever sources are available, mule accounts, telecoms, geography, where the call is coming from and whatever information is available. You have an AI system which is being trained on this information. The idea is that this system will alert before a transaction by saying that this transaction is risky. Now, based on the alert, the customer will have to take a call, or the bank will have to take a call. We expect that this will have a significant impact in terms of reducing the number of frauds that we see in the system. By no means, I am saying that the number of frauds are high. The number of frauds are well under control. If you look at number of frauds per transactions in UPI and others, they are quite low, but these systems will further lower those transactions. Thank you. M. Rajeshwar Rao: Issue of digital locking, which I think I had referred to. I think the issue is under examination as Governor has pointed out. There are pros and cons on both sides in terms of balancing the customer rights and requirements, data privacy, and also the creditors' requirements. We are examining the issue. We will evaluate the pros and cons and then take a view at a later point in time. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sirs. Next, I will ask Ms. Sangita Mehta from Economic Times. Sangita, please. Sangita Mehta, Economic Times: Thank you, sir. Sir, my question is on forms of business. You all have relaxed the guidelines, and you have said that the board of the banks will have the discretion to decide. Why has RBI chosen to relax the norms? And sir, one more thing on this, what would be the specific macro-prudential tools that you would be using for larger exposure framework? Sanjay Malhotra: So, first thing you are saying relaxation. Let me first of all clarify that that was only a draft. It was not a final kind of guideline or a direction. So, the other thing is, see, we do not want to micromanage. We believe that the banks will take a conscious, considered, balanced view depending on their needs as to how they wish to conduct their own business. And so, that is why we have just left it to them. Second question was, what would be the macro-prudential tools, we have number of them, I will leave it to DG MRR. M. Rajeshwar Rao: We have number of tools which are available. May be we can look at, say, putting a cap on the exposure from all the banks because I think the fundamental point which Governor mentioned was the concentration risk. All the banks collective exposure to a single entity. So, we could think of limits for that, but that is something which can be considered at a particular point in time if appropriate. Sanjay Malhotra: And then we have supervision also. We can also put in supervisory measures in case required. Sangita Mehta, Economic Times: But this will be draft first. Sanjay Malhotra: Yes. This is final now. M. Rajeshwar Rao: Forms of business is final. Sanjay Malhotra: Forms of business is final. Sangita Mehta, Economic Times: No, the large credit… M. Rajeshwar Rao: That is a draft circular, sir. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sirs. Next, we will have Mr. Ashish Agashe from PTI. Ashish Agashe, PTI: Thank you so much, sir. A quick follow-up to Vishwanath and Swati's questions. Earlier, there was a perception that financial stability sort of foregrounds RBI's approach on things. Are we to now understand that it is a sort of turn towards being more pragmatic? And sir second quick question. So, how do you look at these adverse weather events right now, since the last policy, there have been more. So, how do you look at this from an inflation and growth perspective? Sanjay Malhotra: I do not think that you should see these measures as any kind of relaxation or kind of letting go our sight from financial stability. Stability is foremost for us. Whether it is price stability, whether it is financial stability, that is foremost not only for us, I think for the country as a whole. It is very, very important because if you do not have price stability, there are consequences. Similarly, financial stability, one episode of financial instability can take you many years behind. So, all of us need to be very conscious of that. At the same time, we have to ensure that we are not in any ways impeding growth or limiting whatever are the fulfilment of the genuine requirements of the various productive sectors of our economy. So, financial stability, price stability will continue to be the primary focus of the Reserve Bank as it is for all other central banks as well. Weather related events, yes, they do have an impact on both growth and on inflation. There have been a number of them. At the same time, let us also keep in mind that the government has also put in place a number of measures. Now, the supply chain management is much better, and they are able to respond to them better. So, that is why we have seen that over the years, despite there being more weather-related events, as you mentioned, inflation has been much better behaved. It is lower in the last 10 years vis-a-vis earlier 10 years. So, at the same time, we will also do whatever is required for the health of our banking system to be able to take care of any weather or climate-related risks. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next question will be from Mr. Ankur Mishra from ET Now. Ankur please. Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Thank you so much for the opportunity. Hello, sir. I want to ask you regarding the rupee depreciation, which you have mentioned in the policy also. You will take measures as and when required. In the MPR, the revision of exchange rate has been there from 86 to 88 this time. I want to understand from you, is the current exchange rate comfortable for you? And also talking about MPR, you have made projections for inflation also 4.5%. In that context, keeping the neutral rates and talking about the real rates here, it is below the estimate. How much of the scope of then easing is there for you? Sanjay Malhotra: What is below the estimate? Ankur Mishra: ET Now: Real rate. 4.5% is the projection which has been given in the MPR. Sanjay Malhotra: Okay. So, your first question was on? Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Rupee. Sanjay Malhotra: So, rupee, see we do not, you asked me whether you are comfortable with this rate, etc. So, we do not target any level or any price band. Our effort has been to manage any undue volatility, and we will continue to do so. Insofar as you are saying the real rate is concerned going forward, you are saying this 4.5%, that is in Q1. So, there are a number of things which go into it, and it is not only inflation that we have to look at, we have to also look at growth in our overall macro, in our monetary policy. And so, based on that, we have continued to retain the policy repo rate at 5.5% and the stance at neutral. Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Mahesh from Financial Express. Mahesh Nayak, Financial Express: Thank you, sir. With all these measures taken, are you still seeing any green shoots in the capex happening in this country, especially with the large corporates, apart from the infrastructure and the renewable sector? Sanjay Malhotra: We had a good number in Q1; we had a good healthy number. A lot of sectors, we are seeing good demand. I think, cement for example, auto, a lot of other sectors - they are seeing a good demand for capex. And on the whole, we are confident that capex will further going forward revive, private capex will revive. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Sir, next, it will be Mr. Aaryan from Informist Media. Aaryan, please. Aaryan Khanna, Informist Media: Thank you, sir. This question is for both the Governor and DG Gupta, if possible. The MPC resolution said that the MPC was waiting for the impact of prior steps to take further action on rates. Eventually, the transmission of the prior actions will take place. Considering your growth and inflation forecast for the next few quarters - what do you think will stop you from cutting rates, especially considering the real and nominal GDP? The real and nominal GDP numbers in the June quarter painted very different pictures of the economy. Thank you, sir. Poonam Gupta: As you know, monetary policy is a forward-looking response. So, while Q1 numbers have actually been surprisingly good, as you said, but there is some softness projected in the second half of the year. And inflation numbers have also been surprisingly very, very benign. So, I guess taking into account both of those developments, as we said in the statement, some room has opened, but it has to be contextualised with everything else that is happening both domestically and globally. So, it is a fast evolving, very, very fluid situation. Yes, Q1 numbers have been good, but those are only one factor in the number of things that we consider for monetary policy action. And that is an important factor, but it is a backward-looking factor. So, to that extent, there is room. But as has been said and has been also repeated by Sir, a number of other things will be taken into account before deciding the next action in December. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, ma'am. Next, we will have Mr. Lalatendu Mishra from The Hindu. Lalatendu Mishra, The Hindu: Good afternoon, Governor. You have partly answered my question that I will be asking. This is about the impact of the tariff on the Indian economy. Have the RBI or the MPC mapped the impact into different sectors? Thank you, sir. Sanjay Malhotra: Yes, we have the map. We have the details. You are aware which are the sectors - gems & jewellery, shrimps, textiles, now may be a little bit of, very little extent, generic branded pharma, which has now come in later, footwear. These are the primary sectors which will be impacted. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Ms. Subhana from The Mint. Subhana Shaikh, The Mint: Hi, sir. So, sir, I wanted to go back to the first question on monetary policy transmission. You said that there has been an impact of yields – they have gone up by 30 to 35 basis points. Now, that has gone up since the June monetary policy and we have seen some headwinds on monetary policy transmission, so what is it that, is RBI concerned about this monetary policy transmission getting impacted through the bond channel? In your assessment, would you bring back OMOs or G-Sec purchases? In what way would you signal to ensure the market that the policy repo rate adjustments would feed through long-term rates? Sanjay Malhotra: See, the primary tool that we have for monetary policy transmission is the policy repo rate and align the policy, the operational target, which is our weighted average call rate (WACR) to the policy repo rate. Last month, it was at 5.46%. There has been broad-based transmission, as I mentioned to you, across all sectors - whether it is money markets, bank credit, even corporate bonds. Corporate bonds five-year AAA corporate bonds are down from their peak by 50 basis points. And similarly, you know, for other bonds also. Similarly, for government securities also. It is a process. It takes time and we are hopeful that the transmission will take place even in other sectors. Please also keep in mind that even in 10-year (bond), as I mentioned, it is about 25-30 basis points. Only because of monetary policy, it had decreased by even more, 60 basis points. There have been certain developments after that. The other thing is 10-year G-sec will not move one is to one. Let us keep that also in mind. 25-30 basis points, while there is scope for more, and we feel that it should head downward, a number of measures have been contemplated in this regard, including how the primary G-Sec auctions will be held. The tenor of these government offerings, not only central government as well as state government, we are quite confident that monetary policy transmission has already happened to a great extent and will continue going forward. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. From the left-hand side itself, Mr. Benn from The New Indian Express. Benn, please. Benn Kochuveedan, The New Indian Express: Hi, sir. One is a complaint or a suggestion. The RBI statements and releases are coming too late these days and too many bunches. It could be given on a reasonable time; can’t we do a better job on that. Like the banking, the seven regulation changes, it came at 10:20 (pm). Or the last bulletin came at 11:30 (pm) or something, it is beyond our capacity to manage. Sanjay Malhotra: We work 24x7. I get the point, and we will endeavour that we bring them out, what time do you want them out? Latha Venkatesh, CNBC TV-18: After 6 is fine. Sanjay Malhotra: By 6, okay. We will issue all whatever documents, press releases primarily, regulations by 6 pm. And if anything is getting delayed beyond 6 pm, then will issue it next day. Right. Fair point. Benn Kochuveedan, The New Indian Express: Sir, my question is, I know RBI does not name individual entities, it is regulated. But this is about the Tata Sons application, which was submitted last year - last August to seeking the de-registration of their NBFC licence. Sanjay Malhotra: Individual entities. We do not comment on individual matters. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you. Sir, next we will have Mr. Piyush from The Hindu Business Line. Piyush, please. Piyush Shukla, The Hindu Business Line: Good afternoon, sir, DGs. Thanks, Puneet ji. Sir, you had issued discussion paper on FIT framework. The deadline for public feedback has gone last year, last month. What is the sort of suggestions that you have received - whether to stick with headline or core, narrowing the band? And by when can we expect, because it is supposed to be implemented from March next year, one? Sanjay Malhotra: Which one? Piyush Shulka, The Hindu Business Line: Flexible inflation Targeting. Sanjay Malhotra: Okay. Piyush Shulka, The Hindu Business Line: Separately, there are over 2,000 urban cooperative banks in the country. We have seen over the past year that there have been governance issues at some of these which has led to substantial fraud and depositors getting hurt. What is the rationale for giving new licences to UCBs? Or do you feel there is still financial inclusion, that penetration is still yet to be done. And just a follow-up to Benn sir’s question, we understand that you do not comment on entities, but this deadline was supposed to be yesterday. So, now what happens? Now, they are non-compliant. So, what is the view we take? Sanjay Malhotra: So, your first question on FIT. See, that is a discussion paper. We have got various suggestions and basis those suggestions, we will now finalise our recommendations as per the provisions of the amended Act. And we will send our recommendations to the government. This was a public consultation. We did so as to enable all stakeholders to participate in the formulation of our views. Our views will be communicated to the government. But we will take into account all views that have come to us. The final decision will be with the government. Second question on UCBs, it is a discussion paper, first of all. So, it has been 21 years, as I said, in the spirit of review, a lot of developments have happened. Banking Regulation Act itself has brought a number of areas, including governance now under the supervision and regulation of the Reserve Bank of India, number of positive developments have happened. After that, however, whether to open up licensing again or not, and if to do it with what guardrails is a question that we will be putting for all of you to respond to and to comment on. And only thereafter, we will be taking a view on it. Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. A couple of questions from the right-hand side, sir. We will have Mr. Krishn Kaushik from Financial Times. Krishna, please. Krishn Kaushik, Financial Times: Thank you, sir. I had the same question that was asked over there. Sir, for Tata Sons, because the deadline has come and passed, does it mean that they have got an exemption for now for floating an IPO? I know it is not a single entity question; it is a policy question because they have not floated the IPO, yet the deadline has passed. Sanjay Malhotra: See, as I mentioned, we do not comment on any specific entities. Any entity which has a registration till it is not cancelled, any entity will continue to do its business. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. And lastly, we will have Mr. Soumyajit Saha from Nikkei. Soumyajit Saha, Nikkei: Hello, Governor. We wanted to talk about the rupee because some of the predictions from the more bearish economists is that a further weakening may be expected over the next few months. There is obviously some benefits coming out of that when it comes to export competitiveness, but there is also the public sentiment side of things. It is something that is often sentimental or even politicised. We just want to understand how the RBI looks at public sentiment around the weakening of the rupee or any such movement. Does that kind of feature in the way you think about it in your considerations of your actions? How important is the public sentiment there? Sanjay Malhotra: See, as I mentioned, we do not target any level, any band. If there is any public opinion, etc., we suppose that gets factored in, in the prices of the rupee. But we do not push or target any band. We only try to maintain, remove any undue abnormal volatility. And we have sufficient reserves, as I already mentioned. There is no reason why it should impact the sentiments or emotions of the public. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. With this, we come to the close of this press conference. Sir, thank you and thanks to all the top management for answering all the questions and making this very interactive. I thank all the media participants for being here and I wish you all a pleasant day. Thank you.",

      "summary": "Secretary, DFS, Shri M. Nagaraju, other senior officials from the Government, Chairman and MDs of SBI, MD CEOs and EDs of Public Sector Banks, and my other colleagues, a very good morning to all of you. 2. I am honoured to be here at PSB Manthan 2025. Personally, this gathering feels like a homecoming, a return to a familiar space of dialogue and shared purpose, where the concerns, aspirations, and vision of our public sector banks take centre-stage. 3. The very word Manthan or churning has timeless symbolism in our traditions. It reminds us that progress rarely comes easily; it requires effort, reflection, and perseverance. Much like a family coming together to deliberate and debate for the common good, PSB Manthan brings together policymakers, regulators, and bankers to churn our collective experiences and insights so that we may draw out the nectar of transformation. 4. I commend the Department of Financial Services for nurturing this platform over the years, and for ensuring that it continues to evolve as a space where ideas are debated, challenges are confronted, and the future course of PSBs is shaped with collective wisdom. The Context: Resilience amidst Global Headwinds 5. We meet today at a time when the global environment remains marked by uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions, shifting trade alignments, climate transitions, and rapid technological disruptions are reshaping the contours of growth and finance worldwide. 6. Yet, amidst these headwinds, the Indian economy continues to demonstrate resilience and stability. This confidence is not only evident in domestic sentiment but has also been reinforced by global assessments, most recently the upgrade of India’s sovereign rating outlook by S&P. 7. Much of this resilience rests on the strength of our banking system. Over the past decade, Indian banks, and particularly our public sector banks, have undergone a remarkable turnaround. Balance sheets have been repaired, capital strengthened, and asset quality improved. At the same time, PSBs have deepened their traditional role as anchors of financial inclusion while also keeping pace with the wider digital transformation of the sector. Their contribution to Jan Dhan Yojana, to direct benefit transfers, and to the expansion of UPI in semi-urban and rural centres, reflects how PSBs combine scale with reach to serve the real economy. 8. Periods of comfort, however, can create the risk of complacency and mistakes are typically made in good times. Therefore, the challenge before PSBs today is not only to stay clear of the earlier shortcomings but to build on the gains of the past decade and transform themselves further. PSBs have to remain strong, adaptable, and future-ready to contribute meaningfully to the vision of a Viksit Bharat by 2047. The Banyan Tree Metaphor: Transforming PSBs from providers of stability to enablers of new growth 9. As we reflect on what this transformation entails, I am reminded of a powerful symbol from our own banking history. Many of you will recall that when the State Bank of India was established in 1955, its logo was a sprawling banyan tree. The choice was deliberate, for the banyan has long been revered as the tree of life. its deep roots embody stability, its sturdy trunk represents resilience, and its wide canopy offers protection to all. 10. In later years, however, the banyan tree logo was replaced by the now familiar blue circle with a keyhole, designed by the National Institute of Design 1 . While the banyan conveyed strength and shade, it also drew criticism for casting such a dense canopy that little else could grow beneath it, which seemed at odds with the image of a modern and accessible bank. 11. Today, for the PSBs, the task is not only to provide shade and shelter to millions of households and enterprises but also to ensure that beneath their canopy, new growth flourishes in the form of abundant and affordable credit to MSMEs, start-ups, women entrepreneurs, and rural enterprises. 12. In that spirit, I find the banyan tree still a fitting metaphor for our PSBs. Its roots, trunk, aerial roots, branches , and canopy together capture the five pillars on which PSBs can build their future. These five pillars in today’s context are strong governance, financial resilience, innovation and adaptability, people and culture, and an all inclusive customer-centricity. Deep Roots: Governance and Assurance – evolve to meet new risks 13. The banyan tree can survive storms because of its deep roots. They may not be visible, but they are the true source of its longevity and stability. For banks, these roots are strong governance and assurance. 14. It means boards that are engaged, leadership that is accountable, and decisions that are transparent and ethical. Regulation can guide, but governance must come from within. Supervisory intervention can fix, but it cannot substitute for an internal culture of integrity. 15. The assurance functions, including risk management, compliance and internal audit, give depth and resilience to governance. They provide boards with independent and reliable perspectives, helping them act with foresight rather than hindsight. 16. Governance today must also evolve with changing times. Boards need sharper tools, such as real-time insights that flag emerging risks or customer concerns. As banks adopt artificial intelligence and data driven systems, assurance must also extend to these new domains. Ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in automated decisions is becoming as important as monitoring credit or operational risk. 17. Deep roots allow a tree not only to survive but also to nurture new growth. In the same way, strong governance supported by robust assurance will allow banks to take on fresh initiatives with confidence, knowing that these are built on a stable foundation of trust. The Sturdy Trunk: Financial Strength and Resilience 18. The trunk of the banyan tree stands tall and sturdy, holding the entire tree together through calm and storm. For our banks, the trunk is financial strength and resilience. 19. Over the past decade, PSBs have strengthened their capital position and improved asset quality. These gains must now be protected and deepened. Banks should hold forward looking capital buffers that reflect their risk profile and growth ambitions rather than simply complying with regulatory floors. Asset quality must also be managed with a preventive mindset, using early warning systems and predictive analytics to identify stress before it becomes a crisis. 20. True resilience today goes beyond capital and credit. It also means operational resilience. With customers relying on banks for 24x7 digital access, even short disruptions can erode trust and create systemic impact. Banks must therefore strengthen their technology infrastructure, cyber safeguards, vendor oversight, and business continuity planning so that services remain secure and uninterrupted under every circumstance. 21. A strong trunk allows the tree to support new branches and new growth. For PSBs, resilience both financial and operational is what will allow them to expand and support India’s development priorities with confidence. Aerial Roots of Renewal: Innovation and Adaptability – for an open, adaptive, tech driven banking 22. The banyan tree constantly sends down aerial roots, which in time become fresh pillars of support. For our banks, these aerial roots are innovation and adaptability. 23. In today’s financial landscape, technology is no longer optional. Modernising core IT systems and adopting advanced analytics are essential to remain competitive. AI/ML can strengthen fraud detection, improve credit assessment, and personalise customer engagement. 24. Innovation is not just about new tools. It is also about smarter ways of delivering them. PSBs should consider shared technology platforms and joint development of digital infrastructure to leverage economies of scale, reduce costs, and ensure consistency in customer experience. They can also experiment with what is known as a digital twin 2 , a virtual model that mirrors a real process such as the working of a branch or the journey of a customer applying for a loan. By testing changes on the digital twin first, banks can identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency before making changes in the real world. 25. Adaptability also means openness to new partnerships. Collaborating with FinTechs including the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), and using other open banking interfaces can bring the best of both worlds - the reach and trust of PSBs combined with the agility of innovators. 26. Yet, greater reliance on technology inevitably increases vulnerability. Cybersecurity, vendor oversight, and business continuity must therefore be built into every digital initiative by design. 27. Aerial roots renew the strength of the banyan tree and allow it to spread further. For PSBs, continuous innovation and adaptability will ensure that their canopy remains relevant, and that fresh growth can thrive beneath it. Living Branches and Leaves: People and Culture – from process-oriented service to empathetic people centric culture 28. The branches and leaves are what people first notice when they see a banyan tree. For banks, they represent employees who bring strategy to life through everyday actions. 29. A large, committed workforce remain the most valuable asset of PSBs, even in an age of artificial intelligence. No algorithm can replace trust, empathy, and human judgment. To keep the branches strong, investment in human capital is vital. Staff must be equipped with new skills in digital banking, cybersecurity, and analytics. Training should be practical and engaging, including simulation-based learning. 30. Equally important is staff attitude and culture. Every customer should feel respected, not merely processed or attended to. True service comes from an empathetic customer first approach. PSBs must therefore nurture a culture of professionalism, empathy, and accountability so that their people remain the strongest ambassadors of trust. The Canopy of Trust and Inclusion – from transaction driven banking to customer centric, trust-based inclusion 31. The canopy of the banyan provides shade to all. For PSBs, it represents their enduring role in customer centricity and financial inclusion. From Jan Dhan to direct benefit transfers, from self-help groups to MSME lending, PSBs have given millions of Indians financial dignity. This role must continue and evolve, for today’s customers expect not just access but also convenience, speed, and fairness. Meeting these expectations requires services that are transparent and responsive. 32. Customer centricity begins with trust. Every complaint is a test of confidence. By not giving room for complaints and by resolving issues, when they arise, promptly and fairly, banks can strengthen that trust and ensure that customers feel empowered in every interaction. Conclusion 33. In villages, it is under the banyan tree that people gather to seek counsel, to deliberate, and to find shade in times of need. In much the same way, citizens look to PSBs not only for loans and deposits but also for inclusion, stability, security, and progress. Let us commit to nurturing this banyan tree so that it remains a symbol of trust and resilience and contributes decisively to the realisation of a Viksit Bharat by 2047. Thank you.

Introduction The nomination facility is intended to facilitate expeditious settlement of claims by banks upon death of a deceased customer and to minimise hardship faced by the family members. The Government of India has notified the Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2025 which inter-alia has amended the Sections 45ZA, 45ZC and 45ZE of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (the Act). The Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 2025 have also been notified which along with amended provisions of the Act shall come into force from November 1, 2025. Accordingly, in order to align the regulatory instructions with the amended provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and corresponding Nomination Rules, it has been decided to review the extant instructions on the subject. II. Preliminary A. Preamble 2. These Directions are issued to provide regulatory instructions to banks to implement the nomination facility and shall be read with sections 45ZA to 45ZG of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (and with section 56 of the Act ibid when applied to cooperative banks) and the Nomination Rules framed thereunder. B. Powers Exercised 3. In exercise of the powers conferred by section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act,1949 (read with section 56 of the Act ibid when applied to cooperative banks), the Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter called the Reserve Bank), being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in public interest to do so, hereby issues the following Directions. C. Short Title 4. These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Nomination Facility in Deposit Accounts, Safe Deposit Lockers and Articles kept in Safe Custody with the Banks) Directions, 2025. D. Effective Date 5. These Directions shall come into force with effect from November 1, 2025. E. Applicability 6. These Directions shall apply to all banks. F. Definitions 7. In these Directions, unless the context otherwise requires, (a) ‘Act’ refers to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. (b) ‘Bank’ refers to a banking company, corresponding new bank, State Bank of India, Regional Rural Bank and Cooperative Bank, as defined in the Act. (c) ‘Rules’ refers to the Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 2025. III. Nomination Facility in Deposit Accounts, Safe Deposit Lockers and Articles kept in Safe Custody G. Nomination Facility 8.(1) A bank shall offer nomination facility in deposit accounts in accordance with the provisions of sections 45ZA, 45ZB and 45ZG of the Act (read with section 56 of the Act when applied to cooperative banks) and the Rules. (2) A bank shall be guided by the provisions of sections 45ZC to 45ZG of the Act (read with section 56 of the Act when applied to cooperative banks) and the Rules in the matter of nomination in safe deposit lockers and articles kept in safe custody. Explanation: For the purpose of these Directions, it is clarified that if an individual is keeping an account for his/ her proprietorship business, it will be deemed as that individual’s account and the nomination facility shall be offered in such accounts. H. Option to the customers not to make a nomination 9.(1) At the time of account opening, a bank shall explicitly inform the prospective customer of the availability and purpose of the nomination facility and offer him/her the option to avail the same. The bank shall also clearly explain to the prospective customer the advantages of the nomination facility, including but not limited to simplification of the claim process in the event of the account holder’s demise and facilitation of smooth and prompt transfer of funds to the nominee without legal complications. (2) If the prospective customer chooses not to avail the nomination facility despite being fully informed, the bank shall proceed to open the deposit account without imposing any restrictions, if otherwise found eligible, after obtaining a written declaration from the individual confirming that he/ she does not require the nomination facility at the time of account opening. If he/she refuses to provide the written declaration, the bank shall record the fact of refusal to submit written confirmation in the account opening records. (3) Under no circumstances shall a prospective customer be denied or delayed in opening an account solely on the ground of refusal to make a nomination, provided all other requirements for account opening are satisfactorily met. I. Incidental Matters 10. In case of simultaneous nomination, if any nominee dies prior to receiving the deposit from the bank, the nomination in respect of such nominee alone shall become ineffective. Accordingly, a bank shall settle the claims of the amount of deposit made in favour of such nominee in accordance with provisions applicable for accounts without nominee clause as contained in Reserve Bank of India (Settlement of Claims in respect of Deceased Customers of Banks) Directions, 2025 as amended from time to time. 11. A bank cannot claim a valid discharge under the provisions of the Act if payments are made to individuals based on nomination made under any other law for specified purposes. 12. A bank shall have in place appropriate systems and procedures to register in its books the registration, cancellation and variation of the nomination, as per the request of the customers. 13.(1) A bank shall devise proper systems for acknowledging the receipt of the duly completed forms of registration, cancellation and/ or variation of the nomination. (2) A bank shall verify and ensure that the nomination(s) made by its customers are in accordance with relevant provisions of the Act and the Rules before providing acknowledgement to them. (3) Such acknowledgement shall be given to the customers within three working days of receiving the forms of registration, cancellation and/ or variation of nomination, irrespective of whether the same is asked for by the customers. (4) Where a nomination request is found not to be in conformity with the provisions of the Act or the Rules and is consequently rejected, the bank shall inform the customer in writing, clearly indicating the reasons for such rejection, within three working days of the receipt of the request form. J. Details of nomination and name of nominee in Passbook/ Statement of Account and Term Deposit Receipt (TDR) 14.(1) A bank shall record the status regarding registration of nomination on the face of the passbook/ Statement of Account and TDR, with the legend \"Nomination Registered\". (2) A bank shall also indicate the name of the Nominee(s) in the Passbook/ Statement of Accounts and TDR in such cases. K. Customer guidance and publicity of benefits of nomination 15.(1) A bank shall give wide publicity and provide guidance to deposit account holders, locker hirers and depositors of articles in safe custody on the benefits of the nomination facility. This may include printing compatible messages on cheque book, passbook and other literature reaching the customers as well as launching periodical awareness drives. (2) A bank shall ensure that the form for opening deposit accounts, hiring safe deposit lockers and depositing articles in safe custody contains space for getting the details of nomination, which also serves the purpose of educating the customers about availability of such facility. IV. Miscellaneous L. Repeal Provisions 16.(1) With the issuance of these Directions, the instructions contained in the circulars mentioned in Annex , issued by the Reserve Bank, shall stand repealed from the effective date of these Directions.

The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e., successful bids will get accepted at their respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities. Bids for the auction should be submitted in electronic format on the e-Kuber platform on November 17, 2025 (Monday) between 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM . The result of the auction will be announced on the same day and settlement will take place on November 18, 2025 (Tuesday). Government of India reserves the right to: Accept offers for less than the notified amount. Purchase marginally higher than the notified amount due to rounding-off effect. Accept or reject any or all the offers either wholly or partially without assigning any reason. Operational guidelines for switch transactions and other details are given in the Annex . Ajit Prasad Deputy General Manager (Communications) Press Release: 2025-2026/1494 Annex Operational Guidelines for Switch/Conversion Transactions with the Government of India Switch module on e-Kuber 1. The market participants can bid in the switch auction through the Switch Transaction module provided in the e-Kuber portal. Bidding in a switch transaction 2. Bidding in the auction implies that the market participants agree to sell the source security/ies to the Government of India (GoI) and simultaneously agree to buy the destination security from the GoI at their respective quoted prices. Placing of bids 3. Each bid should specify the following details: Amount of the source security (Face Value) that the participants are willing to sell. Price of the source security (expressed up to two decimal places). Choice of destination security and the price of the destination security (expressed up to two decimal places), at which the participants are willing to buy the destination security. 4. The participants can choose to bid for any/all the destination security/ies, but the aggregate amount of bids for the source security should not exceed their holdings of the source security in face value terms. Minimum Bid size 5. Minimum bid size would be ₹10,000 and in multiples of ₹10,000 thereafter. The participants are allowed to submit multiple bids. However, the aggregate amount of bids submitted should not exceed the notified amount of source security/basket of source securities in the auction. Price of source security 6. The price of the source security quoted must be equal to the FBIL closing price of the source security as on the previous working day . 7. Bids for source security not as per the price mentioned above will be rejected. Price of destination security 8. Bids for the destination security may be placed after taking into account the price of source security as mentioned above. Method of auction 9. The auction will be a multiple-price based auction, i.e. successful bids will get accepted at their respective quoted prices for the source and destination securities. Auction decision 10. The auction cut-off will be decided based on the price of the destination security/ies . 11. Successful bidders are those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off price. All bids lower than the cut-off price will be rejected. 12. There will be provision of pro-rata allotment, should there be more than one successful bid at the cut-off price. Amount of destination security and dealing in odd amounts during switch auction 13. The switch ratio, which is the ratio of the price of the source security to the price of the destination security, would be rounded off at 8 decimal places. 14. The amount of destination security to be issued for each successful bid will be computed by multiplying the allotted amount (FV) of the source security with the rounded-off switch ratio. The amount of destination security (FV) would be rounded-off to the nearest lower value in multiples of ₹10,000. 15. The odd amount of destination securities (less than ₹10,000) which has been rounded-off, would be notionally allotted and bought back from the bidders at the quoted bid price of the destination security. The net cash consideration to be paid to the bidder for such odd amounts would be the clean price of these securities (as the accrued interest received during notional allotment and paid during notional buyback offset each other). Fund settlement 16. Though the conversion would be broadly cash neutral, there will be fund settlement for the net accrued interest (accrued interest for the source security FV – accrued interest for the destination security FV) for each bid. Cash consideration (due to rounding-off of face value of destination security) computed for each bid would be added to the net accrued interest. Accordingly, fund settlement will be done for the final amount (Net accrued interest + cash consideration) for each bid. Note: An illustration for the calculation of cash consideration due to rounding-off of destination security face value is as given below: Amount of Source Security (FV) ₹10,00,00,000.00 Price of Source Security ₹97.50 Price of Destination Security ₹99.20 Switch Ratio (rounded-off at 8 decimals) 0.98286290 Destination Security FV before rounding off ₹9,82,86,290.00 Destination Security FV re-issued after rounding-off ₹9,82,80,000.00 Odd amount of rounded-off destination security (FV) ₹6290.00 Cash consideration due to rounding off (Clean Price calculated at the quoted price of destination security) ₹6240.00 17. The settlement of the auction would be held on T+1 basis. Help Desk 18. In case of technical difficulties, Core Banking Operations Team should be contacted ( email ; Phone no: 022-69870466, 022-69870415). For other auction related difficulties, IDMD auction team can be contacted ( email ; Phone no: 022-22702431, 22705125).",
