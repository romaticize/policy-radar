      "title": "From Vanji to Viksit Bharat: Banking on Trust, Technology, and Transformation - Address by Shri Swaminathan J, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the 109th Foundation Day of the Karur Vysya Bank on Friday, July 25, 2025",

      "summary": "The Karur Vysya Bank family - represented here by the Chairperson, the Directors on the Board, the shareholders, MD CEO, the staff, officials and the customers of the bank and their families, ladies and gentlemen, Anaivarukkum Vanakkam. Namaskaram. A warm good afternoon. 2. It is both an honour and a privilege to join you here in Karur on the momentous occasion of KVB’s 109th Foundation Day. I extend my sincere gratitude to Shri Ramesh Babu, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer for his kind invitation. 3. Karur is a town where history, commerce, and character are deeply intertwined. It is a place celebrated in Sangam literature as ‘ Karuvoor’ or ‘Vanji ’—a thriving hub of poetry, trade, and craftsmanship, that served as the capital city of early Chera kings. That spirit of enterprise and cultural pride lives on through institutions like KVB. Founding with Foresight 1 4. Today is not just a ceremonial gathering to mark the passage of time. It is a celebration of vision, resolve, and quiet determination—a tribute to those who chose to build a lasting institution in the face of uncertainty. 5. In 1916, as the First World War caused disruptions and hardship, two visionaries from Karur, Shri M.A. Venkatarama Chettiar and Shri Athi Krishna Chettiar, came together to create a bank rooted in trust and community service. 6. The founders travelled across the region, sometimes fording the Amaravati River in a coracle, appealing to landholders and traders and offering their personal guarantees to reassure hesitant investors. Memories of financial failures like the Arbuthnot crash 2 were still fresh, and public trust in banking was fragile. Yet, the founders’ integrity and persistence won the day. KVB was formally registered on June 22, 1916, with a paid-up capital of ₹1.20 lakh, exceeding their original target. Fittingly, the first shareholder was Goddess Gayathri Devi, who continues to bestow her blessings on the bank and its clientele. 7. The bank’s founding team embedded forward-looking principles in its structure: they voluntarily incorporated a clause prohibiting directors from taking loans from the bank—a safeguard that only became a statutory requirement decades later with the Banking Regulation Act of 1949. They also envisaged employee participation in the bank’s future by allotting shares to staff—long before the idea of stock options became fashionable. Each manager was to hold 50 shares, officers 20 shares, and cashiers, reflecting their key role, were to be allotted 40 shares. 8. What they began with prudence and purpose has today grown into a ₹1.86 lakh crore institution, standing as a testament to their values, vision, and unshakeable trust in community enterprise. Banking for Viksit Bharat: Adapting with Purpose and Agility 9. The 109th year of KVB comes at a time of profound change in India’s economy and the broader financial system. As the nation moves towards the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047, banks are being called upon not only to expand credit, but also to play a deeper role—supporting inclusive growth, maintaining financial stability, and driving responsible innovation. 10. I am sure KVB has already taken meaningful steps in this direction. But the journey ahead will demand even greater agility, foresight, and commitment to purpose. 11. In thinking about how banks like KVB can navigate the path ahead, I am reminded of a verse from the Thirukkural, which is a treasure trove of timeless guidance for thoughtful action: “பொருள் கருவி காலம் வினை-யிடனொடு ஐந்தும் இருள்தீர எண்ணிச் செயல்” (Poruḷ karuvi kāalam viṉai-yiṭaṉodu aindhum iruḷtheera eṇṇi cheyal) Literal meaning 3 : “Do an act after a due consideration of the {following} five, viz., Money, means, time, execution and place .” 12. What the sage Thiruvalluvar tells us is this: “The wise act only after reflecting on five things—resources, tools, timing, action, and place or context—to dispel any uncertainty and act with clarity.” 13. To my mind, this is not just classical wisdom—it is a practical framework, deeply relevant to modern banking. These five elements have shaped KVB’s journey so far, and they will be critical in shaping its future. So let us reflect on each of these—not as philosophy, but as building blocks for a strong, agile, and responsible banking institution. Porul (Money/Resources): Using Strength with Discipline 14. In banking, resources are more than just financial capital. They include people, systems, institutional memory, customer trust, and reputation. Sound resource management is all about the quality of decisions and the sustainability of outcomes. 15. It is not enough to meet regulatory thresholds or improve headline numbers. What matters is how these financial resources are deployed—whether they support inclusive lending, long-term investment, or business models that promote trust and transparency. Every rupee must carry intent, not just interest. 16. Equally important are the less tangible, but no less critical, resources that do not reside on the balance sheet. These include the people who engage with customers every day, the internal controls that drive decisions and manage risk, and the institutional values that shape internal culture. 17. A bank’s reputation, once established, becomes one of its most valuable assets. In an environment of rising competition and evolving customer expectations, the way forward lies in building upon a customer-centric approach that fosters trust, loyalty, and long-term value. Karuvi (Tools/Means): Staying Ahead with Responsible Innovation 18. The tools of banking have evolved rapidly—from passbooks and ledgers to core banking platforms, mobile apps, real-time payment systems and artificial intelligence. 19. These tools define how services are delivered, how decisions are made, and increasingly, how risks are managed. In this environment, a bank’s technological capabilities are no longer just operational enablers; they have become strategic differentiators. 20. However, every tool comes with responsibility. The speed and scale of digital adoption must be matched by equally strong investments in cybersecurity, data governance, and ethical safeguards. Recent global and domestic experiences have shown that technology gaps, if not addressed in time, can become points of systemic vulnerability. 21. For banks looking to scale up responsibly, tools must be modern, agile, and continuously evolving. More importantly, they must be well-governed. Technology must never outrun the organisation’s capacity to manage it. Directors and senior management must lead this conversation, ensuring that risk, compliance, and internal audit functions have the resources and visibility needed to keep pace. Kaalam (Time/Timing): Knowing When to Act 22. In banking, timing can be the difference between a breakthrough and missed opportunity, between resilience and regret. Whether it is extending credit, entering new markets, or rebalancing portfolios, the ability to act at the right moment, and with the right judgment, is essential. 23. Timing also requires contextual awareness. Economic cycles, interest rate shifts, regulatory changes, geopolitical developments, and even climate events—all influence when and how decisions should be made. A delay in recognising an early stress, or a rushed response to market signals, can have lasting consequences. 24. But timing is not only about reacting to external events. It is also about recognising when an institution needs to change internally—when to modernise systems, when to refresh leadership, when to pause and consolidate, and when to take bold steps forward. History rewards institutions that act early, rather than those that act perfectly. 25. The founders of KVB acted at such a moment. Their decision to establish a bank in 1916, in the midst of war and economic uncertainty, was bold, timely, and rooted in the needs of the community. The same sense of timing and responsiveness must now guide the bank as it enters its next phase. Vinai (Action/Execution): Converting Thought into Execution – From the Boardroom to the Branch 26. Strategy has little meaning, unless it is translated into action. For a bank, this means ensuring that intent at the top is reflected in outcomes on the ground. Policies made in the boardroom must find meaningful expression at the branch. The strongest frameworks—whether related to risk, credit, technology, or compliance—are only as effective as their execution at the customer interface. 27. Effective action requires clarity, coordination, and accountability. Whether it is launching a new product, entering a new geography, or rolling out a compliance reform, success depends on how well goals are communicated, how clearly roles are defined, and how outcomes are tracked. 28. However, driven by intense competitive pressures and a desire to project short-term success, the management of certain banks and NBFCs appears to believe that the ends justify the means. Practices such as creative accounting, liberal interpretations of regulations, lenient policy frameworks, and inadequate internal controls are being normalised in some boardrooms—necessitating supervisory intervention. Though such instances may be limited, they risk eroding the public’s trust in the integrity of the banking system. 29. Therefore, it is important to pursue growth with systems, people, and processes that are aligned and rooted in ethical practices—from the boardroom to the branch. Idan / Idam (Context/Place): Understanding the Terrain 30. Every institution operates within a broader environment—economic, social, technological, and geographic. The most resilient banks are those that remain deeply aware of their context and continually adapt to it. 31. KVB has long drawn strength from its community roots. Its orientation towards semi-urban and rural markets, and its close connection to the needs of local businesses and households, has shaped its identity and customer relationships. 32. However, context is never static. Changing demographics, climate variability, digital access, migration patterns, and sectoral shifts are constantly reshaping the operating environment. As India progresses towards the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047, banks will be called upon to adapt continuously—to serve a more aspirational, mobile, and digitally connected population. 33. Geographic concentration can bring familiarity, but it also introduces exposure. Regional slowdowns and policy changes can affect concentrated portfolios more acutely. Banks must continuously assess whether their branch network, sectoral mix, and credit exposure are aligned with the emerging realities around them. 34. Expanding into new markets or product segments brings promise, but this also calls for capacity-building—in terms of people, processes, and local knowledge. 35. The most effective banks are those that understand not only their own strengths, but also the terrain in which they operate. For a bank with a rich heritage and legacy like KVB, the ability to balance deep local insight with broader diversification will be key to navigating the next phase of growth. In this dynamic environment, staying true to its community roots while embracing innovation and adaptability is what will truly define the “smart way to bank” 4 . Conclusion: Closing Thoughts for the Road Ahead 36. Let me return, in closing, to the words from Thirukkural that guided my reflections today. It reminds us that lasting success is built not on chance or scale, but on careful thought and considered action. Resources must be used with discipline. Tools must be modern and well-governed. Timing must be informed by awareness. Action must translate intent into outcome. And context must guide judgment at every step. 37. In my address today, I have tried to compress my 37 years of experience—as a banker and, more recently, as a banking supervisor—into the timeless framework provided by the sagacious Thiruvalluvar. His words speak not just to individual wisdom, but to institutional purpose. 38. In the 109 years since its founding, KVB has honoured these principles in many ways—quietly, steadily, and purposefully. But the road ahead will be more complex, more competitive, and more demanding. The institutions that will lead in this environment are not those that move the fastest, but those that move with clarity, with courage, and with conviction. 39. From the Reserve Bank’s perspective, we expect banks like KVB to continue evolving—setting benchmarks in governance and customer service, empowering its assurance functions, and using technology not just for efficiency, but for inclusion. Every Bank Board and management has a responsibility to deepen the hard-earned trust—through service that is responsive, systems that are reliable, and leadership that is responsible. 40. My warmest congratulations to the entire KVB family—past and present—on this remarkable milestone. May the future be built on innovation with prudence, growth with responsibility, and leadership with integrity. 41. Nandri. Thank you and best wishes.

Arbuthnot & Co., a leading British firm in Madras, collapsed due to speculative mismanagement, triggering widespread panic. Thousands of depositors, including pensioners and officials, even the Governor of Madras, lost their savings. The episode severely eroded trust in foreign-run banks and inspired the founding of Indian Bank in 1907. 3 Thirukural 675: English Translation and Commentary by Rev. Dr. G. U. Pope, Rev W. H.

      "title": "Reflections from a Banker’s Journey - Valedictory Speech by Shri Swaminathan J, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India - July 12, 2025 - at the National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM), Pune",

      "summary": "Principal, NIBM, Dr Partha Ray, Members of Faculty, my colleagues from the Reserve Bank of India, and most importantly, our promising future bankers from the PGDM Batch of 2025-27. A very good evening to all of you. 2. It is a privilege to be here at the National Institute of Bank Management—an institution that stands as a pillar of excellence in banking education, research, and leadership development ever since its founding by the Reserve Bank of India in 1969. NIBM has indeed contributed immensely to building intellectual capacity and strategic vision in the sector. This beautiful campus in Pune is not just picturesque—it is a crucible where ideas are forged, careers are shaped, and the future of Indian banking is quietly nurtured. 3. I would like to thank Dr. Ray and the entire faculty for inviting me to be part of this significant milestone in your journey—the beginning of a two-year programme that, I am confident, will challenge you, shape you, and prepare you for the responsibilities ahead. Reflections from the Journey 4. Over the course of my career, I have been fortunate to experience the best of two remarkable institutions—the scale and grassroots connect of the State Bank of India, and the intellectual depth and policy perspective of the Reserve Bank of India. Along the way, I have gathered a few lessons—some from success, and many more from challenges—that I believe may resonate with you, especially as you embark on your journey into the world of banking and finance. 5. You will soon dive deep into subjects like Banking Law and Practice. One of the things you will notice is that banking, unlike many other industries, does not operate solely on the strength of laws and regulations. A significant part of what holds the system together are the conventions and practices established by bankers themselves—what we refer to as Banking Practice. 6. For instance, consider something as familiar as crossing a cheque with “Account Payee”. There is no specific statute mandating it—but it is a time-honoured convention that enhances safety and limits misuse. These practices, developed over time through experience and prudence, carry the weight of law in many contexts. They represent the professionalism, caution, and trust that underpin banking at its best. 7. And so, while your curriculum will cover frameworks, policies, and tools, what will truly shape you as a banker is your ability to blend knowledge with judgment, law with convention, and theory with practice. 8. It is in that spirit that I would like to share four simple reflections—each in the form of a metaphor or analogy—which I hope will serve you well as you begin your own journey. These are: The Lemon, The Lookout, The Deer, and The King. The Lemon 9. You’ve all heard the phrase: “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” I’d like to take it a step further: “Life will give you lemons—so be prepared to make lemonade, lemon pickle, lemon cake… whatever the situation calls for.” 10. Let me tell you about one of my own “lemons”. After completing my two years of probation at SBI, I had hoped to be posted in Bangalore—a city where I had trained. Instead, I found myself in Hubli, some 400 kms north of Bangalore, assigned to the Data Processing Centre of the Bank as a Programmer—a role I had no background of. Computers in the banks were still in their infancy. It was a complete surprise. 11. When I reported, the Personnel Officer told me something profound: “We don’t need computer experts who can learn banking—we need bankers who can learn computers.” That perspective changed everything. 12. It was tough. I had to learn from scratch. But with inputs from institutional training, support from colleagues and a willingness to adapt, I was soon contributing to transforming how the Bank collected and processed its data for feeding into regulatory reporting and executive decision-making systems. 13. The broader point is this: life—and your career—will not go exactly as planned. You may not get the role or the location you desire. But the ability to adapt, to embrace the unfamiliar, and to turn unexpected situations into learning experiences is what will set you apart. 14. So, yes—life will hand you lemons. Don’t just make lemonade. Learn to enjoy the process of learning how. The Lookout 15. On a ship, lookouts are stationed to watch for obstacles, changing weather, and other vessels—long before the captain or crew becomes aware of them. Their job is simple but vital: spot trouble early and alert the team in time to act. 16. One of the most well-known examples is the sinking of the Titanic. Despite its size, sophistication, and engineering, the Titanic struck an iceberg it couldn’t avoid—not because no one saw it, but because it wasn’t seen in time. The ship was moving too fast, and there wasn’t enough time or flexibility to change course. 17. The lesson is clear. In banking—as in life—it is not always the biggest or most advanced systems that succeed. It is the ones that stay alert, that course-correct early, and that respect the value of foresight. 18. As future bankers, you must develop the mindset of a lookout. Banking today is more complex than ever. While digital transformation has brought speed and convenience, it has also created new vulnerabilities—cyber threats, phishing, synthetic identities, deepfakes, and third-party risks. 19. As transactions become real-time and frictionless, the time it takes for damage to occur—and spread—has drastically shortened. Vigilance is no longer optional; it is an essential and core professional skill. 20. Yes, banks need strong systems and protocols. But they also need alert professionals who scan the environment, anticipate risks, and speak up early. You must be that lookout—always asking: What is on the horizon? What could go wrong? What needs attention before it's too late? 21. Innovation and speed are vital. But so are situational awareness, caution, judgment, and the courage to act. Be the one who notices the iceberg early—not the one explaining the damage afterward. The Deer 22. Let us talk about agility—and endurance. Have you ever wondered how a deer sometimes escapes a cheetah—the fastest land animal on the planet? In fact, a cheetah’s hunting success rate is only around 50 per cent 1 . 23. It is not because the deer runs faster. It is because it is more agile. While the cheetah is built for speed, the deer survives by turning sharply, changing direction unpredictably, and using its surroundings wisely. This ability to adapt quickly—to change course in the face of danger—is often what saves it. 24. But there is another crucial factor: endurance. Cheetahs are sprinters, not marathoners. They can maintain top speed only for about 20 to 30 seconds before their bodies begin to overheat. If the prey can hold out just a few seconds longer—keep zig-zagging, stay hidden, or reach denser terrain—the cheetah must slow down or stop. Many hunts fail not because the cheetah is not fast enough, but because it cannot sustain the chase. 25. And each failed sprint comes at a cost. It consumes enormous energy and leaves the cheetah physically drained, needing time to recover. Too many failed chases can lead to exhaustion—and even make the cheetah vulnerable 26. This, to me, is a profound lesson for all of us—especially those entering a dynamic, highly demanding profession like banking. It is not enough to be fast. You must be agile. But equally, you must know how to pace yourself. 27. A good banker isn’t just quick to act—but also able to endure uncertainty, recover from setbacks, and stay focused over the long run. You will face moments of rapid change—crises, deadlines, audits, policy shifts—but you will also need the discipline and stamina to navigate slow, complex processes that unfold over months or years. 28. Agility helps you dodge what’s in front of you. Endurance helps you stay the course. You will need both. The King 29. Finally, let me speak about what I believe is the most important aspect of banking: the customer—the King . I have deliberately saved this for the end, because even if you forget everything else I have said today, I hope you will remember this. 30. \"Customer is the King\" is a phrase we hear often. It is printed on posters, included in mission statements, and used in marketing campaigns. But in banking, it is not just a slogan— it is our duty. 31. The number of customer complaints—especially through digital channels—has risen significantly in recent years. From social engineering frauds to poor grievance redressal, the loss and frustration is real. Often, the problem is not the product or service—but, as I see it, the real issue is a lack of empathy . 32. We see increasing automation but decreasing ownership . Systems respond with templated emails; helplines loop back endlessly. This is not how trust is built, and certainly not how it can be sustained. 33. When I was a young Field Officer in SBI, we took pride in truly knowing our customers. Nowadays, KYC is often reduced to a periodic ritual. Today’s banker must find a way to bring back that personal awareness and responsibility —even in a digital context. 34. A senior citizen struggling with an ATM pin… A borrower in a rural area unsure how to repay digitally… A small business owner worried about a UPI refund… 35. They are not just service requests. They are moments of trust. They all deserve your time, your patience, and your professionalism . 36. Technology will enable the transaction. But only you can build the relationship and only you can earn the customer’s trust for your institution. Finally, that is what will distinguish a banker from an app. Closing Reflections 37. Over the next two years, you will be immersed in the principles and practices of modern banking—credit, risk, compliance, technology, analytics, and more. NIBM will equip you with the tools. But how you use them —with empathy, curiosity, and integrity—is what will define your journey. 38. You are entering a profession that is not just about managing money—it is about managing trust. 39. Your decisions will impact individuals, families, businesses, and communities. You will play a role in financial inclusion, digital adoption, credit growth, and economic stability. That is no small responsibility. So, remember to lead with character and conviction. 40. With this I wish you all the very best in your journey ahead. Thank you, Jai Hind. 1 “Do Cheetahs Always Catch Their Prey?” Kenya Wild Parks, 18 July 2024, www.kenyawildparks.com/do-cheetahs-always-catch-their-prey/",

      "title": "Working Together, Growing Stronger: Responsible Governance for a Resilient UCB Sector - Valedictory Address by Shri Swaminathan J, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Seminar for Directors of Urban Co-operative Banks held in CAB, Pune on Friday, July 11, 2025",
      "url": "https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?id=1514",
      "source_name": "Reserve Bank of India - Speeches",
      "publication_date": "2025-07-18",
      "summary": "Chairmen and Directors of Urban Cooperative Banks; Shri Jaikish, Principal of the College of Agricultural Banking; my colleagues from the Reserve Bank of India; ladies and gentlemen - a very good afternoon to all of you. 2. I am honoured to be here today to address you at the culmination of this seminar’s deliberations on the theme ‘ Resilient Cooperatives for the Future: Enhancing Governance in a Digital Age ’. 3. This seminar, thoughtfully organised by the College of Agricultural Banking, comes at a very appropriate time. The United Nations has declared 2025 as the International Year of Cooperatives, with the theme ‘ Cooperatives Build a Better World ’, recognising the vital role cooperatives play in building inclusive, fair, and resilient communities - something that India’s own cooperative movement has long exemplified. 4. With a proud history of over a century, cooperatives have become powerful engines of grassroots development. From Amul and IFFCO to SEWA and India Coffee House, India’s cooperatives have shown how collective effort can drive both economic and social progress. 5. UCBs have long been an essential part of India’s cooperative story, providing banking services to segments - often underserved by larger banks - small traders, self-employed individuals, salaried workers, and others in the informal sector. What sets UCBs apart is their deep-rooted presence in the community and their ability to offer personalised, responsive service, customers are at ease walking into their neighbourhood UCB branch. This reflects the essence of the cooperative model - banking built on relationships, local knowledge, and grassroots connection. 6. With this unique identity as a cooperative bank, comes a substantive responsibility. While UCBs are rooted in cooperative values, they are banks - licensed to accept public deposits and expected to operate with the same prudence, integrity, and accountability that banking demands. Banking is built entirely on the trust of depositors. Trust must be earned and protected every single day - through sound governance, effective risk management, and an unwavering commitment to depositors’ interests. 7. Recognising both the importance of UCBs and the challenges they face, the Government and the Reserve Bank have taken several steps in recent years to support the sector’s stability and growth. Based on the recommendations of the Expert Committee chaired by former Deputy Governor, Shri N. S. Vishwanathan, a four-tiered regulatory framework was introduced to bring proportionality in regulation. The establishment of a sector-wide Umbrella Organisation was also facilitated to help address issues of scale, particularly in technology and capacity building. Recently, the priority sector lending guidelines for UCBs were revised in response to feedback from the sector. 8. While these measures reflect the commitment of the Reserve Bank and the Government to support and strengthen the UCB sector, lasting progress must ultimately come from within. Government and regulators can enable, but it is the internal resolve and discipline of each institution that will determine its long-term resilience. This calls for a renewed focus on governance, professional management, and strong internal systems. It is therefore essential that you, as Directors, take the lead in building institutions that are capable, forward-looking, compliant, and - most importantly - worthy of the trust placed in them. 9. Let me now turn to five key areas where, as Directors, your role is especially critical. These are not merely regulatory expectations - they are the essential building blocks of strong and sustainable institutions. In each of these areas, your focused attention and leadership can make a meaningful difference to the future of your banks. Strengthening Governance and Accountability 10. My first area is on strengthening governance and accountability. Time and again, our supervisory experience has shown that the root cause of distress in cooperative banks is not external shocks, but weak internal governance. Whether it is high levels of non-performing assets, instances of fraud, or erosion of capital, the underlying issues often trace back to poor oversight, lack of independent judgement, and inadequate checks and balances at the Board level. 11. While you are not expected to manage the day-to-day operations - that is the responsibility of senior management - as Directors, your role is not to merely endorse decisions, but to actively engage, ask the difficult questions, and ensure that the bank is being run in a prudent, ethical, and transparent manner. 12. All dealings must be at arm’s length, and related-party transactions must be approached with utmost caution and full transparency. This applies not only to lending decisions, but also to appointments and other administrative matters - please follow a fair and transparent process without fail. 13. Strong governance begins with active, informed, and independent Boards - Boards that place the long-term interests of the institution and its depositors above all else. Building Robust Assurance Functions 14. The second area I want to highlight is the importance of strong internal assurance functions - namely, risk management, internal audit, and compliance. These are not back-office support roles. They are your eyes and ears within the organisation, helping you identify risks early, monitor controls, and ensure that operations align with regulatory expectations and internal policies. 15. However, these functions can only be effective if they are given the independence, stature, and access they require. They must have the freedom to escalate concerns without fear. They must have the skills and seniority to command respect within the institution. And most importantly, they must have a direct line of communication with the Board - especially with the Audit and Risk Management Committees (especially for those UCBs, where we have mandated RMCs). 16. As Directors, you must engage actively with these functions - not just to review their reports, but to understand what is happening at the ground level. Ask questions. Seek clarifications. Ensure that red flags are not ignored or rationalised. A well-functioning risk, audit, and compliance setup is the foundation of a safe, well-run bank. Engaging Constructively with Auditors and Inspectors 17. The third area I would like to emphasise is your engagement with statutory and internal auditors, as also with supervisory teams. These stakeholders are not adversaries - they are valuable partners in safeguarding the health of your institution. 18. Auditors play a crucial role in independently validating the bank’s financial position and internal controls. Their observations must not be treated as routine or transactional. Engage with them meaningfully. Understand the concerns they raise and ensure that necessary corrective action is taken - not just in form, but in spirit. 19. Likewise, the inspection reports issued by the Reserve Bank should be viewed as a tool for strengthening your bank - not as a fault-finding exercise. These inspections are a critical last line of defence, aimed at identifying risks before they become unmanageable. 20. As Directors, it is essential that you read these reports carefully, discuss them thoroughly at the Board level, and ensure time-bound action on the issues flagged. Avoid the temptation to look for comfort in favourable metrics alone. Instead, focus on understanding the root causes of any weaknesses and most importantly, in fixing them decisively. Embracing Technology with Responsibility 21. The fourth area I want to highlight is the growing importance of technology - and the need to adopt it with foresight and responsibility. 22. In recent years, customer expectations have changed dramatically. Digital payments, mobile banking, and round-the-clock service are no longer luxuries - they are now basic expectations. 23. Many UCBs are eager to offer internet and mobile banking, and that is a welcome aspiration. However, digital services require a strong and secure technological foundation. If the underlying systems are weak, the infrastructure outdated, or the staff unprepared, the bank - and its customers - become vulnerable to serious risks such as fraud, data breaches, and prolonged service disruptions. 24. Cybersecurity is not just a technical issue - it is a governance issue. The Board must be fully aware of the bank’s digital capabilities and its cyber risk profile. Any decision to expand digital offerings must be based on a realistic assessment of readiness and must be accompanied by appropriate investment in systems, processes, and people. 25. Digital transformation should not be about ticking a box or keeping up with trends. It must be a strategic choice, aligned with your bank’s risk appetite, customer profile, and operational capacity. Above all, it must be anchored in a commitment to provide secure and uninterrupted service for your depositors. Supporting Collective Strength through the Umbrella Organisation 26. The fifth area I want to highlight is the importance of collective action - and the opportunity that now lies before the sector through the Umbrella Organisation. 27. In today’s environment, the challenge of limited scale has become more pressing for UCBs - particularly in areas such as technology adoption, cybersecurity, risk management, and compliance. As banking becomes more technology-intensive and regulatory expectations rise, the cost of staying competitive and secure is increasing. For many individual UCBs, making the necessary investments while maintaining profitability is becoming increasingly difficult. The creation of the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Ltd. (NUCFDC) - as an Umbrella Organisation - was a response to this evolving challenge. 28. The Umbrella Organisation is envisioned as a shared platform that can support member banks with common technology solutions, centralised services, capacity-building programmes, and improved access to modern tools and expertise. It can be a force multiplier - especially for smaller UCBs - allowing them to benefit from economies of scale while retaining their unique identity and local focus. NUCFDC is also expected to provide certain fund-based facilities to member banks such as supporting them in capital enhancement, providing refinance, and addressing short term liquidity requirements. 29. The success of this initiative, however, depends on broad-based and active participation. The cooperative movement has always drawn its strength from unity. The Umbrella Organisation offers an opportunity to renew that spirit - by building shared resilience for a digital and dynamic future. Conclusion 30. Let me conclude by reiterating that Urban Cooperative Banks matter. You represent a model that is built not just on profit, but on purpose. 31. As the financial landscape evolves, however, the expectations from you, especially as Directors, are also rising. Governance must be sharper. Risks must be better understood and managed. Technology must be adopted thoughtfully and securely. Above all, the trust of your depositors must remain non-negotiable. 32. Therefore, each of you has both the opportunity and the responsibility to shape the future of your institution. 33. The Reserve Bank stands with you - as a regulator, as a guide, and as a partner. Let us work together to ensure that UCBs remain a strong, resilient, and vibrant part of India’s financial system. 34. Thank you, Jai Hind.",

      "publication_date": "2025-07-18",
      "summary": "Distinguished guests, participants, colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me at the outset thank the organisers for having me here to share my thoughts on this important topic. Climate risks and green infrastructure financing, as a catalyst for achieving net-zero emissions, has to move over time from the margins of policymaking to the heart of global and national agenda and occasions such as these should help in this endeavour. 2. Climate change is a phenomenon which we are seeing and living through on a daily basis. With each passing year, the extremes of weather patterns are becoming more intense. Whether it is extreme rainfall, droughts, heat waves or cyclones, changes and aberrations have become the norm. The incidents of formation of heat dome over USA or the monsoon rains hitting Mumbai before the scheduled onset reflect recent examples of the climate change. The probability of changing weather patterns is going to be more regular and its economic impact very severe in the times to come. A recent report 2 on economic cost of extreme weather events estimates that over a ten-year period from 2014 to 2023, economic cost associated with climate-related extreme weather events amounted to $2 trillion. Notably, the estimated cost over the last two years taken together i.e., 2022 and 2023, was around $451 billion. Moreover Climate-induced disasters also disproportionately affect the poorest nations and communities. 3. The scale of the impact of events arising out of climate change therefore requires sizeable investments in technology and scale of finance to both build resilience and enable mitigation. As per OECD report 3 , the investment required for green and sustainable infrastructure is estimated at around USD 3 to USD 5 trillion per year until 2050. This is not just a nominal allocation of capital resources - it would require a significant shift of financial flows, complemented with appropriate policies, and reorientation of institutional priorities. The question is no longer about if but how to finance this transformation, which must then be our collective resolve going forward. Financing sustainable and green infrastructure can no longer remain a peripheral concern; it has to now become central to achieving both global and national net-zero targets, and for fulfilling the commitments of the Paris Agreement. These aspects are important for climate risk mitigation and facilitating a just transition. While more than 140 countries over the world have made commitments to net-zero targets—the real challenge lies in their achievement. Climate finance remains significantly off-track, fragmented, overly reliant on public funds and often inaccessible to the developing countries that need it most. So, the question before us is both urgent and clear: How do we catalyse sustainable and green infrastructure financing to deliver on the promise of net-zero? Let me share a few thoughts on this. Sustainable and Green Infrastructure – The need of the hour 4. For, the current period marked by climate related volatility, limited resources and widening inequality, sustainable and green infrastructure is likely to be a necessity. The infrastructure whether in the form of power plants, highways, apartments, commercial buildings, or fuel pipelines, must be taken as steppingstones towards achieving the goal of net-zero in carbon emissions and not emerge as barriers in achieving these targets. According to a World Bank study 4 , every single dollar invested in climate-resilient infrastructure can save up to four dollars in avoided losses. Green and Sustainable infrastructure not only improves the quality of life through cleaner air, accessible mobility, and more efficient public services, while remaining climate friendly, it also helps in reducing vulnerability and inequality, particularly in communities that are prone to climate risks. Creation of climate resilient infrastructure reduces disaster risks and prevents catastrophic losses from floods, cyclones, and heatwaves. It also reduces the volatility of losses that may occur on corporate balance sheets in the face of physical climate risks, thereby help in improving financial stability. While the arguments for climate resilient infrastructure are compelling, the hurdles are many. It has been estimated 5 that less than 1.5% of total assets under management (AUM) of global investment funds are aligned with Paris goals. Green infrastructure pipelines in emerging markets remain underdeveloped and the climate finance gap which is estimated at over $2.5 trillion annually 6 , is widening. Financing Sustainable and Green Infrastructure – Issues and Challenges 5. While discussing sustainable and green infrastructure, the first step is to establish a clear definition and reach a consensus on what qualifies as green infrastructure. The green taxonomy plays a critical role in this regard. The government has recently released the draft of the climate finance taxonomy for public consultation, which paves the way for much-needed uniform classification across the economy and financial system. The draft taxonomy lays down four essential criteria viz. avoidance of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, reduction of GHG emissions intensity, adaptation solutions that reduce the risk of adverse impacts of climate change and research and development, for classification related to climate finance. But the key to enable sustainable and green infrastructure is technology. New technologies can lead to reduction in emission intensities, increase energy efficiency, provide alternate energy sources to help avoid GHG emissions, and build innovative solutions to drive adaptation and resilience towards mitigating the perils of climate change. 6. This dependence on technology is however both the enabler as well as the main constraint on the flow of finance. Let me elaborate a bit. Finance always follows the principle of risk and reward. Financial institutions adopt risk-based pricing for financial products, considering both the borrower's risk profile and the inherent risks associated with the proposal. The technologies underlying sustainable and green infrastructure are still evolving and are therefore less reliable regarding their future viability as compared to the traditional technologies, which are comparatively stable and have stood the test of time regarding cash flow generation. There may also be lack of technical expertise and capacity among the creditors in understanding these evolving technologies. Hence, compared to traditional technologies, there are higher perceived inherent risks related to sustainable and green infrastructure technologies which then get reflected in their risk pricing. Sustainable and green projects thus often face higher upfront costs including capex requirements. The perceived risks associated with sustainable and green infrastructure limit access to debt financing for early-stage technologies, highlighting the need for greater equity investment (First Loss Default Capital). Other constraints relate to longer payback periods creating asset-liability mismatches, information gaps, lack of robust assurance and verification functions, which limit understanding and appraisal of these technologies to prepare investment-grade infrastructure projects i.e., those with well-defined cash flows, clear governance, and measurable impact metrics. 7. Climate change risks directly impact the real economy, and the financial sector in turn gets impacted on account of its credit exposure to the real economy. For the financial sector to perform a comprehensive risk assessment, relevant information flow from the real economy i.e. corporate/institutional borrowers in a timely manner is important. Given that climate change and climate risks is likely to impact a business segment consisting largely of MSMEs, unorganised sectors and un-listed corporates, creating an awareness and understanding amongst these borrowers on climate change risks and obtaining the required information becomes important. 8. Understanding climate change is an elaborate process involving the use of complex models to analyse the weather and climate patterns to predict the changes. Along with historical data, projections of climate variables such as rainfall, and temperature, are also inputs for forward looking risk estimations. However, the financial system or financial analysts have limited exposure to climate science. At the same time climate scientists have limited understanding of financial modelling and risk estimations. This creates a gap between these two input streams and that challenges us in accurately estimating the risks associated with sustainable and green infrastructure finance. The availability of climate related data with proper understanding about its sources and methodology of its estimation is essential for financial analysts to aid their decision making. 9. Since sustainable and green infrastructure technologies contribute to the reduction or avoidance of greenhouse gas emission intensity, a critical consideration for financing entities is to address the risks of green washing. For a creditor to fund any project which is intended to achieve reductions in GHG emissions, there is a need to clearly understand how these projected reductions are being quantified. It would also require a robust and independent Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) function. Standardised processes and databases to inform and quantify such benefits would be necessary to increase the funding avenues for such infrastructure projects. 10. There are several building blocks or ecosystem enablers which are required to be fostered and promoted to remove the bottlenecks surrounding sustainable and green infrastructure projects. Without innovative financial instruments to mitigate early-stage risks, lack of availability of avenues for blended finance, many projects lack the scale or bankability needed to attract private capital. These limitations are further exacerbated in case of emerging market economies as inadequate financial instruments, and fragmented institutional coordination are critical constraints that are further exacerbated by poor sovereign ratings which leads to further increase in risk premium particularly when trying to access global funds. Global funding, where available, is predominantly denominated in foreign currencies, exposing borrowers to exchange rate risks and consequently increasing the cost of financing - despite their need to access low-cost funds. Moreover, globally climate finance availability is spread across several funds which have different application procedures, eligibility criteria, and reporting standards, which makes it onerous and time consuming for ensuring flow of such funding. These factors lead to institutional paradox with capital seeking sustainability, while sustainable assets seeking capital are unable to scale up and access these funds. Catalysing the finance to Sustainable and Green infrastructure 11. Given the issues and challenges, our focus should be on identifying effective ways to mobilise the financing required to transform our infrastructure landscape toward green and sustainable development. Let me float a few ideas for you to ponder on. To unlock the required flows into green and sustainable infrastructure, we need a holistic reconfiguration of the financial ecosystem - one that rewires risk, institutionalises sustainability, and aligns incentives. We need to follow a building block approach whereby the ecosystem enablers are first put in place, thereafter harmonised and made consistent across all the sectors. We could categorise these enablers in two categories as endogenous and exogenous enablers. The endogenous enablers refer to the requirements of information flow, data gap bridging, MRV requirements, and building up of technical expertise. They can then act as the lynchpin between the availability and requirement of credit flow and cover the entire ecosystem right from the appraisal to disbursement and monitoring of finance related to sustainable and green infrastructure projects. These enablers will prepare the financial system to cater to the financing needs and facilitate the flow of funds with greater certainty. 12. The exogenous enablers would involve mechanisms that can be built to cater to the innate risks associated with green and sustainable infrastructure, which is requirement of risk capital, first loss default capital, concessional funding, quantum of funding, global funding, public and private capital mobilisation. Blended finance, which combines concessional public finance with private capital, is essential for bridging the bankability gap of green and sustainable infrastructure. There is a need for an adequate mix of public and private funding where the public funds crowds in the private funds through appropriate incentive structure. Specific mechanisms need to be enabled wherein global funds scale their mandates from project-level support to market-shaping interventions, also targeting underdeveloped sectors like adaptation infrastructure, and nature-based solutions. There is also requirement for Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), National Development Banks (NDBs) and Vertical Climate and Environmental Funds (VCEFs) to harmonise approach and operations and enable joint funding to enable shift from being direct lenders to catalytic partners and bring in economies of scale in sustainable and green infrastructure projects financing. Instruments like first loss guarantees, and subordinated debt, which can de-risk early-stage investments and crowd in institutional capital are also required. 13. Scalability of finance towards any cause comes either from policy nudges or market mechanisms that adequately incentivises risk taking. Once the endogenous enablers are in place, supported by exogenous enablers, innovative financial instruments such as sustainability linked loans, transition finance instruments, green debt securities etc., can get the required traction for enabling the flow of finance. Digital solutions are changing the way traditional finance works and that innovation needs to be channelised to the cause of sustainable and green infrastructure. Digital tools to automate MRV requirements, and data and information flows, can bring down compliance costs substantially. I would request all the tech enthusiasts to innovate and bring in solutions in this regard. To foster tech-based innovation in finance, RBI has instituted a regulatory sandbox wherein innovative solutions can be tested to provide market wide scalable solutions. RBI has also allowed ‘Theme Neutral’ applications as part of the ‘On Tap’ facility under the regulatory sandbox under which application containing any technology / theme can be made under various topics including sustainable finance and climate risk mitigation. Tokenization may soon enable fractional investment in infrastructure, opening new liquidity channels and investor bases. This approach needs to be explored for sustainable and green infrastructure. Fintech, blockchain, and AI have the power to streamline project verification, improve traceability, and democratise access to green and sustainable finance. We must capitalise on these efforts to establish an infrastructure pipeline of sustainable and green projects, a repository of vetted, investment-ready projects across sectors and regions. We must also empower local governments, indigenous communities, and civil society to lead climate infrastructure efforts. This may include decentralised renewable energy systems, sustainable land use practices, and community-based adaptation projects. 14. No country can achieve net-zero in isolation. Climate change is the quintessential global challenge and so too our response. There is a requirement of enhanced global cooperation in this regard which must also extend to technology transfer, R&D funding, and skills development to enable development of technical expertise to identify, design, and structure bankable sustainable and green infrastructure projects. The focus needs to shift from project-based finance to overall market development with policy reforms, development of a project pipeline, and consistent regulatory frameworks, creating systemic conditions for fostering sustainable and green infrastructure finance. The international financial architecture also needs to be reoriented toward sustainability. The de-risking of sustainable and green infrastructure can work best when national, local, and multilateral institutions co-invest, signalling policy credibility and technical robustness. MDBs and global climate funds may need to revisit their governance structure to reflect the voice of recipient countries, particularly the global south and not just donor countries. Innovative financial instruments such as debt-for-climate swaps and climate-resilient debt clauses must also be scaled up to create fiscal space for green investments. We all need to work towards the creation of a reformed, empowered, and climate-aligned multilateral financial system. Conclusion – Financial Leadership - Call to Action 15. The transition to net-zero is not just about finance, but also about knowledge, trust, and solidarity. We are at the crossroads or in climate terms nearing a tipping point. This is a moment not only for climate policy, but for the financial leadership to act together. A sustainable and green infrastructure is the best legacy we can pass on to the future generations. As finance professionals and leaders, we need to act in unison to foster endogenous and exogenous enablers and build a robust ecosystem to scale climate finance to catalyse green and sustainable infrastructure in a prudent manner. We need to align our mandates and approaches with the country’s net-zero pathways, innovate and strategise and collaborate globally, even as we may act locally. The Reserve Bank of India has been proactive in its resolve to facilitate creation of a robust ecosystem wherein the assessment and mitigation of climate change risks are fostered and its impact on the economy and financial system is curtailed. In this context, we have followed a building block approach, focused on wide stakeholder consultation, capacity development, channelising flow of credit towards green finance, efforts to bridge limitations such as climate data gaps and modelling challenges, and building a conducive regulatory framework for risk assessment balancing compliance and conduct. 16. We need bold and urgent action to finance the future requirements. There is a need to catalyse the capital that helps to build the world we need. Sustainable and green infrastructure is the foundation of climate action, economic resilience, and social justice. It is a significant lever for us to achieve net-zero targets, protect our communities, and create a more equitable world. The future has been built and will continue to be built, one way or another. The question is: will it be sustainable? And what can we do to ensure it? Let me leave you with these thoughts and wish you all successful deliberations and fruitful outcomes during these meetings. Thank you. 1 Inaugural Address delivered by Shri M Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India at the Conference on Green Infrastructure Finance on July 03 at College of Agriculture Banking, RBI, Pune in Collaboration with Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) India.

      "source_name": "Reserve Bank of India - Speeches",
      "publication_date": "2025-07-02",
      "summary": "Ladies and gentlemen, Good Morning. At the outset, let me thank the organisers for inviting me to deliver the keynote address at this milestone event and congratulate Trans Union CIBIL (TU CIBIL) on its 25th anniversary. Credit reporting and TU CIBIL have grown together in India and the company has made a significant contribution in expanding the footprint of credit reporting in the country. Credit reporting systems today operate as a key element in the national financial architecture, encouraging greater credit access, supporting financial inclusion, enabling effective supervision, and enhancing financial stability. This silver jubilee therefore also represents a significant milestone in TU CIBIL’s ongoing contribution to strengthening this framework. This also gives us an occasion to reflect on how the information gap between the credit institutions and the borrowers has been addressed over time and the possible way ahead. Evolution of Credit Information Companies in India 2. To set a context to the theme of this speech, it may be worthwhile to reflect briefly on the evolution of credit information companies in India. The Reserve Bank had recognised the need for establishing a Credit Information Bureau for collection of credit information from lending institutions and for the provision of such information to the financial system and had set up a Working Group in 1999 for the purpose. Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd. (CIBIL) was thereafter incorporated in 2000, and over the years, three other Credit Information Companies (CICs) have also started their operations in India. 3. A variety of challenges had hindered wider acceptance of credit information companies over the years. The key obstacles included inconsistent quality in data submitted by lenders and shortcomings in consumer protection mechanisms. Therefore, a committee was set up in 2013, to examine the issues hampering the sector and based on its recommendations, significant policy changes were made in 2014 2 . These included standardisation of data formats for individual, corporate and micro finance borrower segments, institutionalizing the mechanism of Technical Working Group comprising of representatives from various regulated entities and introduction of Data Quality Index for improving data quality. 4. In the recent past, our focus has been on taking regulatory measures to improve quality of data and ensure faster redressal of customer grievances. Several policy measures have been taken to reduce information asymmetry, enhance data quality and improve customer satisfaction. Just to illustrate, these steps included mandating availability of free full credit report (FFCR) to individuals, appointment of internal ombudsman by CICs, extending the Reserve Bank’s Integrated Ombudsman Scheme to CICs, introduction of a framework for granting compensation to customers for delayed rectification of their credit information and increasing frequency of credit reporting. RBI directions have also mandated the CICs to display the list of suit-filed accounts of large defaulters and wilful defaulters on their website. 5. The role of data and emerging technology in enabling credit access is therefore extremely topical and relevant at this juncture. But if we were to go back in time, 25 years back, lack of information and high cost of access to information hindered access to credit to large segment of the populace, the financially excluded. It was in this scenario that credit reporting started to take root in the country, and we have traversed a long road since then. Apart from greater access to secured lending, the creditors gain confidence to underwrite unsecured loans, facilitated by access to credit information provided by the CICs as this reduces the information gap that existed earlier between even the prime borrowers and the lenders. 6. While CICs have undoubtedly played an important role in reducing the information asymmetry thereby facilitating better credit decisions, they are not going to be the only game in town to source the required data, as information asymmetries are also sought to be addressed through other complementary mechanisms. This trend is driven by the digitalization of financial services and electronification of records which has created a large repository of data which can be used to get better handle on economic trends, both micro and macro. This coupled with the growth of FinTechs and innovations in financial services, has created business opportunities to harness alternate data sets in order to gain a better understanding of financial behaviour and credit worthiness of individuals and entities. These insights can give a richer perspective than conventional analysis and provide an impetus to the measures taken to foster greater financial inclusion. Let me highlight a few of these developments, technology led, and regulator supported. CERSAI and CRILC 7. In 2011, the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (CERSAI) was incorporated, initially for operating a registration process under the provisions of SARFAESI Act. Over the years, it has developed into a complete registry containing security interest of immovable, movable, intangible properties and assignment of receivables. By providing access to all kinds of creditors and the facility for filing of attachment orders and court orders, CERSAI delivers a comprehensive status of any encumbered / attached property. 3 The Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC), was set up in 2013 by the Reserve Bank to collect, store and disseminate information on large credits of scheduled commercial banks, all India financial institutions and certain non-banking financial companies. These initiatives have undoubtedly helped banks and other financial institutions in improving their credit administration besides providing vital inputs for supervisory risk assessment on build-up of credit risk in the financial system. Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) 8. At the heart of the FinTech revolution in India is India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) — a framework that integrates technology, markets, and governance to serve public interest. The DPI includes Unified Payments Interface (UPI) which is the flagship instant mobile digital payments system, interoperable across any bank account or app, Aadhaar Digital ID for over a billion adults, Aadhaar Payment Bridge which facilitates cash transfers directly to beneficiaries' bank accounts, Aadhaar Enabled Payments System (AEPS) which is an interoperable network of biometric based cash withdrawal & deposits, DigiLocker which is an e-Locker for storing verifiable credentials, Bharat Bill Payments System, now called Bharat Connect for bill fetch & pay, and FastTag - a near field communication based toll charges and parking collections platform. This is supplemented by the Account Aggregator Framework, another cog in the DPI, which is a cross-sectoral framework for consented financial data sharing. Apart from facilitating credit delivery, this is an initiative towards open finance. It has now come a long way and is growing rapidly with onboarding of financial institutions, since guidelines were first issued in 2016. The inclusion of Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) as a financial information provider under the account aggregator framework is expected to give further impetus to cashflow based lending to MSMEs. Unified Lending Interface (ULI) 9. The latest addition in the Digital Public Infrastructure for credit is the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), designed to simplify and democratize credit access by offering lenders regulated, seamless access to verified borrower data. The convergence of Jan Dhan Accounts, Aadhar and Mobile Phones, popularly known as the JAM trinity, UPI and ULI, represents a significant advancement in India’s digital lending infrastructure. One of ULI's standout features is its ability to tap into alternative digital data, enabling access to credit even for those without formal financial histories. Its integration with NABARD’s e-KCC portal is expected to extend access to customers of District Central Co-operative and Regional Rural Banks, previously excluded from formal digital channels. Integration of state-level digitized data, such as land records and cooperative databases into the ULI framework, would provide novel cash flow-based lending solutions. Going forward, the potential for ULI to also harness data from e-commerce platforms and gig economy apps could open new doors for credit inclusion for small sellers, delivery workers, and freelancers. Improved access to credit 10. When we evaluate the outcomes of these measures, we can see the significant changes and benefits. Over the years, India’s household debt as a percentage of GDP has increased and stands at ~43 percent in 2024. This rising trend is fuelled more by an expansion in the number of borrowers rather than just through an increase in average indebtedness 4 . Despite some moderation observed recently, the growth in deployment of bank credit under ‘retail/personal loan’ category witnessed a CAGR of approximately 17 percentage over the past five years. 5 Moreover, the composite Financial Inclusion (FI) - Index to measure and evaluate the extent of financial inclusion too has improved substantially from 49.9 in 2019 to 64.2 in in 2024 indicating progress in deepening of financial inclusion in the country 6 . This reflects two important facets of credit that need to be borne in mind. First, the availability of credit to individual borrowers has improved and second the improvement in the FI- Index reflects reduced frictions in credit delivery with consequential improvement in financial access. Digital initiatives for MSME sector 11. A targeted beneficiary of increased use of data and technology in credit decisions should be the MSME sector, which remains the backbone of India’s economy. With over 7.34 crore enterprises, contributing nearly one-third of our GDP and 46% of exports, this sector is key to our economic future 7 . Increasing the availability of credit to the MSMEs has been a policy priority of the Reserve Bank and the Government of India. However, MSMEs have faced several challenges in accessing formal credit such as information asymmetry, excess documentation and lack of transparency. Here the role of CICs has become important. When commercial credit reporting is efficient, creditors need to rely less on relationship lending and soft information, and more on facts and fact-based analyses based on credit reports and other credit reporting products. Rise of FinTech Ecosystem 12. It needs to be recognised that of late FinTech players have emerged as powerful enablers, transforming how credit reaches previously unserved and underserved populations. By leveraging the power of technology, they have significantly lowered the cost and complexity of delivering financial services to the last mile. This has not only improved user experience but also addressed persistent challenges that had kept many outside the formal credit fold. Importantly, we are seeing a growing collaboration between FinTechs and traditional financial institutions. This partnership is particularly impactful in credit origination and supply chain finance, where it bridges gaps created by physical infrastructure and human resource constraints in remote and rural areas. For example, in FY 2024, FinTechs have processed approximately 47% of small ticket personal loans of less than 1 lakh, by count. 8 Open Credit Enablement Network and Open Network for Digital Commerce 13. The Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) that facilitates interactions among lenders, borrowers, and loan service providers, effectively uniting all participants within the credit ecosystem on a common platform to streamline credit delivery, is also poised to be a significant part of the fintech landscape. It is expected to enable lenders to make more informed credit decisions by utilizing alternative data sources, such as cash flow information. Going forward, there is a promising scope for deeper integration between OCEN and the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). Such interoperability could democratise credit access further and open new avenues for MSMEs to participate in digital commerce, fostering broader economic growth on multiple fronts. 9 Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for credit disbursement 14. The proposed use of programmable CBDC for credit disbursement is another pioneering initiative. One commercial bank’s pilot for tenant farmer lending under Kisan Credit Cards, where programmable CBDC ensures end-use monitoring, looks promising. Even without land records, tenant farmers are being extended formal credit, based on livelihood activity tracking. If successful, this model could be replicated for collateral-free loans to micro-enterprises, street vendors, and artisans, where end-use assurance allows for responsible, productive lending. The digital nature of such disbursements also creates valuable digital footprints, which can enable further lending and reduce dependence on government schemes. Leveraging Tokenisation for Credit Delivery 15. Tokenisation i.e. generating and recording a digital representation of financial or real assets on a programmable platform could be an option that can offer enhanced efficiency, transparency and accessibility, and may be seen as the next step following dematerialisation and digitalisation. It could favour small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs’) access to credit by narrowing the information gap. Further, SMEs could improve their collateral offering by tokenising real assets or trade receivables, thus improving their standing in the credit markets 10 . Tokenisation may also enable simultaneous asset transfer and payment in a financial transaction, minimizing counterparty risk and thereby considerably reducing the need for collateral. Role of AI/ ML in facilitating credit delivery 16. One of the main challenges in the provision of credit facility, especially among underprivileged populations, is the absence of credit history. By using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), algorithms can evaluate alternative data from diverse sources to determine creditworthiness more accurately. In fact, it seems that time is not far when alternative data will no longer be alternate, but it will be the mainstream. This advancement would allow lenders to extend credit to individuals who were once deemed ineligible. Use of AI/ML could simplify the disbursement process by automating credit assessments and risk evaluations, which not only accelerates fund distribution but also cuts administrative costs, making it practical to offer small loans even in remote regions. Moreover, AI models excel at uncovering previously hidden insights in data, enabling financial institutions to more precisely forecast their clients’ funding requirements and creditworthiness. They also streamline compliance workflows, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, which significantly cuts operational costs and increases their speed of lending. Microfinance and microloans which serve as crucial support systems for underserved communities are likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this advancement. Grameen Credit Score 17. Another initiative that is on the anvil is the Grameen Credit Score. This score will be in addition to the existing credit score and will be specifically designed to enhance financial inclusion in rural areas, particularly for members of self-help groups (SHGs). It aims to address the limitations of existing generic credit scoring systems by creating a tailored framework for assessing the creditworthiness of rural borrowers. This measure can improve access to formal credit for rural populations, including farmers and marginalized communities. Role played by the Reserve Bank 18. In this dynamically evolving scenario, the Reserve Bank has been endeavouring to create an enabling regulatory environment for fostering innovation and ensuring financial system integrity. With a view to put in place a regulatory framework for FinTechs that maintains a balance between maximising their creative potential while minimising the idiosyncratic risks they pose to the financial system; the Reserve Bank issued a Framework for Self-Regulatory Organisation(s) in the FinTech Sector in 2024. The Reserve Bank Innovation hub, a wholly owned subsidiary of RBI, commenced an initiative to foster a vibrant infrastructure for facilitating the progress of FinTechs in the country. The initiative - Fintech and Startup Acceleration (FAST) - aims to connect the stakeholders, viz., the startups, incubators, accelerators, investors, regulators and banks and financial institutions to accelerate innovation and financial inclusion. Through the HaRBInger initiative, Reserve Bank is encouraging the global innovation community to solve real-world problems with a special focus on inclusive design and accessibility for differently abled persons in the digital finance journey. To foster continuous innovation, we have made the Regulatory Sandbox ‘on tap’ and ‘theme-neutral’. 19. Even as we embrace these sweeping changes, we must remain cognizant of the need for addressing issues around data accuracy, data security, and model risk. These could present significant challenges in the effective deployment of data-driven systems. Inaccurate or incomplete data can undermine the reliability of analytical outputs and decision-making processes, while poor data security can expose organizations to breaches, resulting in legal liabilities and reputational damage. Additionally, the use of complex AI and machine learning models introduces concerns around model risk, especially when these models are not thoroughly tested, validated, or monitored for biases and performance drifts. Rigorous validation protocols, continuous monitoring, and robust governance frameworks are essential to ensure that these models remain fair, transparent, and aligned with regulatory and ethical standards. While we should be willing to embrace new technologies and modern regulatory approaches, the core values - integrity, transparency, and commitment to public service - should drive our innovation and initiatives towards financial inclusion. Innovation needs to be responsible and accountable. It should not be at the cost of an individual’s rights regarding the use of their personal data. Looking ahead 20. The path ahead is filled with opportunity and responsibility. For the CICs let me outline two critical enablers i.e. (i) Enhancing Data Freshness and (ii) Improving Data Quality. Currently, credit data is refreshed on a fortnightly basis. We must aspire to more frequent updates. Real-time or near-real-time credit reporting will improve underwriting precision, enable timely reflection of borrower actions like loan closures or repayments and deliver a superior consumer experience. This shift requires investments in technology, process reengineering, and change management. But the rewards - transparency, efficiency, and trust, far outweigh the costs. Similarly, data quality is the bedrock of responsible lending and Reserve Bank has always emphasised the importance of accuracy in regulatory submissions. It has been prescribed that CICs shall provide a data quality index score to the Credit Institutions (CIs) on a monthly basis to facilitate improvement in the quality of data submitted by CIs. Another key challenge is identity standardization. CICs rely on credit institutions to provide accurate and validated IDs. Without this, duplication and misreporting remain risks. We must move towards a unique borrower identifier, which is secure, verifiable, and consistent across the system. 21. We stand on the cusp of a transformative financial era where technology, policy, and innovation converge to democratise credit access. Various initiatives, collaborative partnerships and sustained regulatory support are laying the foundation for a more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable economy. But at the heart of a sustainable credit landscape lies an empowered consumer which is enabled when we have a financially aware and literate customer. While regulations mandate transparency and awareness, the responsibility needs to be fulfilled by all of us. Financial literacy cannot be achieved through a one-time campaign; it has to be a sustained commitment for all the institutions and entities involved. While the institutions in the financial system have done commendable work, the journey is far from complete. The setting up of Credit Information Companies was in one sense the starting point of this journey of financial inclusion and democratisation of credit. Even as the journey continues, the role of the CICs remains integral and important in realizing the vision of Total Financial Inclusion.

      "summary": "Distinguished guests, participants, ladies and gentlemen, Good evening. At the outset, let me thank the organisers for inviting me to share some of my thoughts on the theme of financial inclusion. Before that, let me take a moment to acknowledge that today i.e., June 05, 2025, is the World Environment Day, an UN-recognized day that brings together people across the globe in a shared mission to safeguard and restore our planet. This year’s theme of ending plastic pollution is a call to all of us to make a behavioural shift in our daily life choices. In the spirit of preserving the purity of our environment and safeguarding our well-being, let us commit toward making more sustainable choices. 2. Coming back to our theme for the day, let me begin by stating the obvious that financial inclusion is not just a policy objective but a collective obligation and responsibility for all stakeholders in the financial ecosystem. The importance of the theme can be underscored by the fact that at least seven out of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 view financial inclusion as a key enabler for achieving sustainable development worldwide by improving the quality of lives of poor and marginalized sections of the society. It is seen as a way to bridge the gap between the privileged and the under-privileged and a way to bring people out of poverty. An inclusive financial system has the potential to reduce income inequality and poverty, promote social cohesion and enable shared economic development. It also can dissuade the disadvantaged and low-income segments of society from seeking out informal options that renders them vulnerable to financial distress, debt, and poverty. History of Financial Inclusion in India 3. Given the theme for today’s discourse, it would be worthwhile to set the historical context regarding financial inclusion in India. While the financial inclusion initiatives in our country can in many ways be traced back to the 1950s, with significant developments ensuing in the subsequent decade, it was the National Credit Council meeting of July 1968 that paved the way for framing of Priority Sector Lending (PSL) guidelines, nationalisation of select private banks in July 1969 and launch of the Lead Bank Scheme in December 1969 that were the precursors of this journey. The branch expansion policy adopted by RBI during the 1970s, which required a specific number of branches to be opened in rural areas for every branch opened in urban areas, became the foundation for expanding the reach of banking services that we see today. Besides, the experiments with group-based lending towards the turn of the last century and proliferation of microfinance institutions have also helped link the unserved section of the population with the formal banking system. 4. Interestingly, the above initiatives were taken during a period when the term ‘financial inclusion’ was not prevalent in the country. The first reference to the term was made in RBI’s Annual Policy Statement for the Year 2005-06 by Dr Y.V. Reddy 2 , the then Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, who highlighted ‘financial exclusion’ that resulted due to certain banking practices. Banks were then urged to review their existing practices to align them with the objective of financial inclusion, leading to the genesis of ‘no frills’ account, which are now known as Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts. Financial Inclusion in Indian Context 5. The first step in promoting financial inclusion is understanding its nuances, which are as dynamic and diverse as the Indian economy itself, and thereafter outline its ambit in the Indian context. Given its multi-faceted nature, various organisations and jurisdictions have defined financial inclusion in different ways. In India, the formal definition of financial inclusion 3 was given in January 2008 by the Committee on Financial Inclusion chaired by Dr C Rangarajan as “the process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low-income groups at an affordable cost”. Reflecting the priorities of that time, the definition focused largely on the access to financial services. Currently we have a scenario, where more than 95% households have access to a bank account 4 , which reflects remarkable progress on one out of three parameters of Financial Inclusion Index developed by the Reserve Bank to measure the extent of financial inclusion in the country. 6. While there has been a significant progress in expanding the banking reach, it is also important to ensure that inherent barriers to a gamut of financial products and services are eliminated and usage of these services expands to various segments of yet underserved and un-served population in the country. Efforts towards making financial services accessible become futile if they are not used by the intended population or are used without appropriate awareness of its risks and benefits. Thus, the other two parameters of RBI’s financial inclusion index, viz., usage and quality of the financial services cannot be overlooked while defining or measuring financial inclusion. Over the last few years this index has shown reasonable improvement, but there is a scope for improvement in some aspects. Current Scenario 7. To get a perspective on the current scenario, it would be worthwhile to dwell a bit on some of the recent developments in the journey of financial inclusion in the country. Several policy measures towards furthering financial inclusion have been undertaken from time to time, but it was the launch of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) that became the watershed moment in this journey. The Jan Dhan Yojana – Aadhar – Mobile i.e., JAM trinity provided a quantum leap in our endeavour to ensure access to banking services for all adults, making it the world's largest financial inclusion program. As of May 21, 2025 5 , 55.44 crore Jan Dhan accounts, 56% of which belong to women, have over ₹2.5 lakh crore worth of deposits, which speaks volumes about the impact of the scheme. The provision of universal access to bank accounts has not only increased the potential reach of other financial services but has also enabled frictionless delivery of welfare programs to the targeted segment through adoption of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). Digital Payments 8. Access to a bank account is a prerequisite for availing other financial services, and a robust payments and settlements system is an indispensable enabler for proliferation of formal financial services. Over the past decade, the fundamentals of banking have changed with the advent of digital modes of banking like net banking and mobile banking as well as digital payments systems like Unified Payment Interface (UPI). In FY 2024-25, digital payments surged 35% Y-o-Y by volume to 60.81 crore transactions per day, with UPI accounting for 83.73% of such transactions 6 . The extraordinary uptake of UPI stands as a testament to the power of collaborative and use-case-driven innovation in driving financial inclusion. A particularly compelling example of this transformation can be seen in the informal sector—where today a street vendor or pop-up store owner nonchalantly places a QR code at the fore and receives payment for services without any hassle for cash and quietly integrating himself into the formal financial system with dignity and ease. 9. For further expanding and deepening the digital payments ecosystem in the country, a Payments Infrastructure and Development Fund has been constituted to encourage deployment of payment acceptance infrastructure. Further, all State and Union Territory Level Bankers’ Committees have been advised to identify districts and assign them to designated banks, with an endeavour to make these districts 100 per cent digitally enabled. The objective is to provide every eligible individual in the identified district at least one mode of digital payments viz., cards, net banking, UPI, AEPS 7 , etc. It is understood that as on March 31, 2025, 514 districts across 15 states and 6 UTs are 100 percent digitally enabled. This marks a significant milestone in our journey towards a digitally inclusive economy. RBI’s financial inclusion index. 10. RBI’s financial inclusion index, which captures the extent of financial inclusion across the country, with four iterations published till date, has increased from 60.1 in March 2023 to 64.2 in March 2024, showing a Y-o-Y increase of 6.82 per cent. While the progress is appreciable, credit gaps still exist in the system which may be attributed amongst others to a lack of documentation available with the individuals/ entities in the informal system and of awareness regarding the various government schemes. There is as such a need to make concerted efforts to fill them. Recent regulatory initiatives 11. The RBI has been sensitive to need to bring about improvement in the financial inclusion in the country. Some of the measures taken recently in this regard include raising the limit for collateral-free agriculture loans to ₹2 lakh per borrower, enhancing various loan limits under PSL, expansion of the list of eligible borrowers under the category of ‘Weaker Sections’ alongwith removal of existing cap on loans by UCBs to women beneficiaries. The scope of co-lending is proposed to be broadened by expanding the list of permitted regulated entities (REs) that can enter a co-lending arrangement and extending the same beyond PSL loans. A comprehensive review of the Lead Bank Scheme is also underway with an objective to enhance the effectiveness and impact of the scheme. 12. With respect to digital payments, permissible transaction limit on UPI Lite has been revised in FY 2025 from ₹500 to ₹1000 and on UPI 123PAY from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 to encourage their wider adoption. Further, with a view to promote digital payments among individuals without bank accounts, UPI Circle has been introduced which allows a secondary user to make UPI transactions up to a limit from the primary user’s bank account in a secure manner. Besides, in an effort to enhance ease of access to digital infrastructure for persons with disabilities, payment system participants (PSPs) have been advised to review their payment systems and devices and carry out necessary modifications so that all such systems and devices can be easily accessed and used by persons with disabilities. Financial Literacy 13. Meaningful financial inclusion also requires access and awareness in right proportions for ensuring responsible and equitable service delivery of financial services. Therefore, financial literacy and financial inclusion need to be considered as two sides of the same coin – promoting financial inclusion without adequate financial literacy would lead to underutilization of financial services and increased chances of errors and frauds. Conversely, educating the consumers without facilitating their access to the formal financial system would result into unmet demand for financial services. The efforts towards augmenting financing literacy have been institutionalised by setting up of the National Centre of Financial Education (NCFE) jointly by the financial sector regulators. RBI as a regulator has been at the forefront of financial literacy with the launch of annual Financial Literacy Week campaigns targeted at specified sections of the population. Financial awareness empowers borrowers to assess and understand financial products, thereby supporting informed decision-making. To facilitate informed decision making by the customers and enhance transparency by the lenders, the RBI has mandated that all REs provide a standardised disclosure of key terms and conditions in the form of Key Fact Statement (KFS) to all retail and MSME borrowers. Challenges 14. Even as all the stakeholders in the financial system, including the regulator and the REs, play their part in advancing financial inclusion, certain issues that act as impediments to the efforts made in this regard have come to the fore and will need to be addressed. Let me briefly highlight a few such issues. Grievance Redressal 15. Having an effective grievance redressal mechanism is non-negotiable for financial sector enterprises as non-resolution of consumer’s concerns not only leads to erosion of customer base but also results in loss of trust in the broader financial system and deters new consumers from entering the system. It is concerning that the complaints received at the Offices of RBI Ombudsmen as well as Centralized Receipt and Processing Centres (CRPCs) marked a sharp 33% year-on-year increase 8 in FY2023-24. This raises questions on the products, practices, and handling of grievances at the level of the RE. REs, therefore, need to analyse the gaps and strengthen their processes to reverse the trend of increasing grievances. Mis-selling 16. While financial inclusion entails a bouquet of financial services, pushing the same indiscriminately to unaware consumers may be detrimental to their well-being and undermine its stated intent. There are reports of mis-selling of financial services such as insurance products. The concern is that such mis-selling without regard to suitability and appropriateness would beget distrust in schemes aimed at providing a safety net to the low-income households by creating artificial boundaries. We are examining whether it necessitates framing of guidelines to address mis-selling of financial products and services by REs. Cyber Safety and Digital Literacy 17. As digitalization becomes more pervasive, the need for increasing digital literacy becomes even more pronounced. Empowering individuals to use digital devices and platforms with confidence and security is essential to ensuring inclusive participation in the digital economy. Often, apprehensions related to uncertainty, the possibility of errors, or financial loss create psychological barriers that hinder the adoption of technological solutions such as ATMs, mobile banking, and other digital services. The rising incidents of frauds through novel techniques makes it imperative that REs collaborate with other stakeholders like SROs, NGOs, etc. to generate awareness and promote safe digital practices among customers. 18. At the same time, it is critical for REs to implement effective measures to combat digital frauds. One such area warranting attention is the use of One-Time Passwords (OTPs) as a means of Additional Factor Authentication (AFA). While this method has served well in the past, the evolving threat landscape in the arena of cybersecurity now calls for the development and adoption of more secure and resilient alternatives. Further, REs must diligently adopt the designated 160 number series 9 for all service and transactional voice calls as prescribed by the Government. This initiative is critical to maintaining the integrity of communication channels and protecting customers from phishing and other forms of cyber-attacks. 19. RBI has been running extensive multimedia awareness campaigns using audio-visual messages under the name ‘RBI Kehta Hai’ and text messages as ‘RBI Says’. Further, RBI has introduced the bank.in and fin.in domains exclusively for banks and non-bank entities to curb cyber security threats and malicious activities. Also, to aid the customers in verifying Digital Lending Apps’ (DLAs) association with RE, the RBI has created a public repository of DLAs deployed by the REs which will soon be available on RBI’s website. Developments in Microfinance 20. Let me now focus on a few developments in Microfinance sector. Microfinance has placed itself as a promising avenue for providing formal financial services to the excluded sections of population. While microfinance has played an important role in financial inclusion, there are some issues which need attention. The sector continues to suffer from vicious cycle of over-indebtedness, high interest rates and harsh recovery practices. While some moderation in interest rates charged on microfinance loans has been observed in recent quarters, pockets of high interest rates and elevated margins continue to persist. Even lenders having access to low-cost funds have been found to be charging margins significantly higher than the rest of the industry and which in several instances appear to be excessive. The lenders should look beyond the conventional “high-yielding business” tag for the sector and approach it with an empathic and developmental perspective, recognising the socio-economic role that microfinance plays in empowering vulnerable communities. 21. The frequency of disruptions in the microfinance sector has increased of late. Incidents of high borrower indebtedness, coupled with coercive recovery practices, sometimes lead to tragic consequences. It is in the collective interest of all stakeholders that such disruptions are pre-emptively addressed and avoided. In this regard, REs must also enhance their credit appraisal frameworks to prevent over-leveraging of borrowers. Additionally, they must eschew any coercive or unethical recovery practices, ensuring that financial services are delivered in a manner that is both responsible and sustainable. While the business model may be sound, the organisational structure and the incentive schemes framed to deliver the services may be flawed resulting in perverse outcomes for customers. This calls for an introspection around the models. Way Forward 22. Even as we reflect on some of these challenges, we need to be clear about the path that we must take to ensure greater financial inclusion. As we look to the future, the way forward for financial inclusion lies in the strategic deployment of emerging technologies to build a more accessible, equitable, and efficient financial ecosystem. Innovations such as AI, blockchain, and digital public infrastructure are revolutionizing how financial services are delivered, especially to the underserved and remote communities. One such innovation in this space is the Account Aggregator (AA) framework. By empowering individuals to securely share their financial data with consent, the AA system enables more accurate credit assessments and potentially facilitates the delivery of customized financial products. Building on this foundation, the Unified Lending Interface (ULI) standardizes and streamlines the digital lending process by providing lenders with a host of alternate data including digitised state land records, milk pouring data and satellite data. It’s RBI’s belief that the JAM trinity will be followed by the new trinity of JAM-UPI-ULI in revolutionizing digital infrastructure and credit delivery and provide necessary fillip to financial inclusion efforts, pushing it to new highs. 23. The development and implementation of India Stack has revolutionised the banking landscape in India and has been instrumental in furthering financial inclusion by reducing infrastructural, geographical, and linguistic frictions and plugging leakages. REs have been encouraged to innovate in product design, offering solutions that reflect the unique needs of their customer base; for instance, offering flexibility in repayment schedules, variable savings contributions, and locally tailored financial products shaped by seasonal income cycles, occupational patterns, or behavioural tendencies. Such customisation can go a long way in further improving access, usage, and quality of financial services. REs can bring some of these innovations under the theme neutral ‘On Tap’ Regulatory Sandbox framework, which provides a structured environment for testing state-of-the-art solutions in the interest of consumers and financial stability. As connectivity can pose challenges in remote and rural areas, REs can explore the development of lightweight mobile applications and web interfaces optimised for low-bandwidth environments. These measures will go a long way in extending the reach of digital financial services to the last mile, thereby ensuring inclusive and accessible banking for all. 24. A lot has been achieved in the journey for achieving financial inclusion thus far, yet a lot more needs to be done. It cannot be merely achieved by standalone policy initiatives but by implementation of such initiatives both in letter and spirit by all stakeholders in the financial ecosystem. Also, those who remain outside the ambit of formal finance today represent untapped potential that can meaningfully contribute to economic growth in the future. The dividends of such inclusion will not only accrue to the institutions involved but will also strengthen the foundation of a more resilient, equitable, and prosperous society. Financial inclusion should not be viewed as an act of philanthropy, but rather as a strategic investment in the nation’s economic and social development. With the right mix of well thought of and carefully crafted regulation, technological advancement, and institutional empathy, our collective efforts can dismantle longstanding barriers and usher in a new era of inclusive and sustainable financial growth – one that leaves no citizen behind and resonates far beyond set boundaries.

I would take this opportunity to welcome Dr. Gupta to this press conference, after taking charge as the Deputy Governor. We also have with us Executive Directors, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan and Dr. Ajit Joshi, and other friends from Reserve Bank. Before we begin, I will request all of you to please either switch off your mobile phones or keep it on silent. Please restrict to one question per person, so that everybody gets a chance, and then may be going forward, we can take another question if time permits. And when you are asking questions, please see that you switch on the mic which is in front of you, because that is how people listening to this transmission would be able to hear whatever is transpiring here. And once you are done, please switch it off to avoid the interference. Sir, there are 23 participants from media today, and with your permission, I will call out the names. I will ask Latha to ask her question. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Thank you, sir. Latha from CNBC-TV18. Governor, thank you very much for the opportunity and for a policy that is giving us a lot of headlines. Okay, I wanted to clarify things on the liquidity front. In the last few weeks, the call rate was not at the repo rate. You gave enough liquidity, and the call rate was 25 basis points below the repo rate. Now that you have given a 50-basis cut, will you use liquidity in such a way to align the call rate more to the repo rate, which means you will do more VRRRs - reverse repos? Or will the reverse repo have to be suspended, because your $40 billion short positions will mature? So, if you can give us a little more colour on liquidity. And on the stance, itself, is it fair on the part of the market to assume an extended pause? Or because the positive real rate, if you assume that 1.4 to 1.9 positive real rate is what you are also going by, then with inflation at 3.7 (per cent), you still have space to cut. So, should the market assume that the terminal rate can still go down after the pause? Sanjay Malhotra: Yes. First of all, thank you all of you for coming here as usual and taking our message to everyone across the country. So, thank you very much. You have asked three questions in one question, but we will try to attempt to answer all of them. So, first question is a very good question. In fact, what do we do with liquidity? Where do we actually maintain now the call rate? The call rate today is hovering at the lower end of the LAF, as it was till yesterday. So, it was at about 5.75%. Whether we now maintain it at 5.25% or at the policy rate, which is at 5.5%, that is as I said, we will see how the situation goes. Of course, liquidity is abundant, and if we do not do any VRRRs, then it is going to stay at 5.25%. If we do VRRRs, then we can bring it anywhere between, depending on the amount. So, we will see how the situation evolves, and we will take a call. We have not really given it a thought on that. So, we will decide, and you will come to know in the coming few days. I will not be able to give you a very precise answer. But having the policy at 5.5%, and the stance now going to neutral, all that will certainly come in the picture. We will take a call as to where we will try to have the call rate. The second question is on where do we see the terminal rate? The MPC, I think, has very clearly articulated that in the statement, in the resolution that has come in, we have changed the stance from accommodative to neutral. And it has mentioned that there is now very limited space for the monetary policy, actually, given the current circumstances. And you are aware of the current circumstances, which is that growth is at about 6.5%, inflation we are projecting at 3.7% for this year, and next year it is above 4, it's 4.5% or roundabout. So, given these current, if these were to play out, there is very limited space is what MPC says and that is why it has been reduced now, we have changed now to neutral. MPC also states that we will continue to monitor the incoming data, and basis that, given especially the uncertainties, what way now we will move will depend primarily on what the data suggests to us. There was a third question. That's it. Thank you. So, I have answered all. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: That's what I wanted. Yes. If you can allow me another question, I will ask? Sanjay Malhotra: Yes. We will come back later and see, if there is time. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Mayur Shetty from The Times of India. Mayur Shetty, The Times of India: Governor, you spoke about the uncertain environment, and a lot of uncertainty is coming from the behaviour of the US administration, and that is also resulting in a lot of volatility in dollar assets. So, given this, how would you balance between rebuilding the forex reserves and managing exchange rate volatility? Sanjay Malhotra: See, our policy over there is very, very clear. It has been very consistent. And we do not manage or try to target any price, any level, any band, you are aware of that. If there is any abnormal - that's a standard response, right? - any abnormal volatility, if it is there, that is what we try to counter, and we let the prices be determined by the markets. Now, this question, and I think that was something that even Latha alluded to, and that was the third point I think that you mentioned is this $40 billion, etc. We are not unduly concerned about that. Even if you were to exclude that $625 billion. If we were to exclude $65 bln, including the one over year which is coming in, we are not unduly worried on that. It is a very, very comfortable level to be in. Yes, if there are opportunities and we can build reserves, that will happen, but that is not something which we will be unduly bothered about. Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now, I will request Mr. Anurag Shah to ask his question. Anurag Shah from ET NOW Swadesh. Anurag Shah, ET NOW Swadesh: Thank you, sir. Thank you. Sir, you have given such a big surprise, so what main question that I had, that also I will ask later, aside. Sir, what is the purpose of today's announcement, and what message do you want to give broadly? Sanjay Malhotra: Broadly, the message is that inflation is under a lot of control, and we can assume that we have won the war. This is the message, because we have reduced inflation forecast from 4% in our opinion to 3.7%. In the same way, the growth rate forecast is 6.5%. It is good, but there is still room for improvement. So, whatever we have to do, we believe that we should do it decisively, and at the right time. And I think the certainty that is there in this uncertain environment, we certainly needed to give that certainty to the markets, banks, and the economy. That is why, as you saw, the MPC said that we have done a front load, so that there is certainty that yes we have to reduce the basis points by 50%, so we did it at the same time. In the same way, the CRR, if we wanted, we could have announced it 4 months later. We have announced it today itself, so that people, banks, are assured that liquidity that we have said is for sure, but it should be transformed into actions as well. So, we have transformed them into actions as well. Like we have announced the CRR today itself. So, the more certainty there is, the more we believe that our economy will get strength from it. And this is our message that our economy is doing well. And keeping the economy in mind, and keeping the inflation in mind, it is our key message, we will not get distracted from that at all. That is our primary motive, that we should control the price stability and inflation, and we curb it. And whatever target is given to us; we should try to take it towards that target. When that happens, then we should also pay attention to the growth. That is what we have done. Anurag Shah, ET NOW Swadesh: The stance which you changed in the last policy, from neutral you came to accommodative. And this time, in the same policy, you went back to that stance. So, then are you not sending a wrong message? Sanjay Malhotra: Wrong message, I did not understand? Yes, you can say that. It was in our mind also, that we had made it accommodative last time. We had a choice that we should have kept it accommodative. We kept saying that it (stance) is accommodative, but we would not do anything. So, action is much more important, and whatever we are talking about should be transformed into action. That is why we had our statements of intent- accommodative was just an intent. If we would not have changed it, kept it accommodative only, so, would it have been better? Or should we give certainty that yes, whatever we promised you on accommodative, that we will reduce the rate, we will reduce it decisively. We have done that, and we have neutralised the stance. In today's circumstances, the situation is such that there is very little scope, as the MPC noted, there is very little scope to reduce the policy rates. Very limited space. So, there is very limited space, so there remains very little scope for further reduction in policy rates. This is the entire message that we wanted to give, that is why we had kept in neutral. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Moving to this side of the table, Mr. Manojit Saha from Business Standard. Manojit Saha, Business Standard: Namaste. Good afternoon. Thank you, Puneet ji. Again, on this stance, this policy had several surprises. The most surprising part is the stance. As you said in the last policy, the accommodative means the rate can go down or it can stay there. So, neutral would mean the rates can go up. Are you saying rate will not go up, but there will be a long pause? And whether there was a voting on stance, if you can share? Sanjay Malhotra: It will depend on data now. This is what neutral means. We had explained it in the earlier MPC statement that neutral will mean that it can go either ways. It will depend on how the data comes in. If the growth is weaker, it can mean that it will go down. If the growth is good, inflation is going up, it can mean that the repo rate, policy rate can go up. So, it will depend on how the data, both on inflation as well as growth turns out. Manojit Saha, Business Standard: Was there voting on stance this time? Sanjay Malhotra: Stance, see we have already mentioned that the statute does not mandate a voting. There was a discussion on it, certainly, because we need to give a sense, we need to give a guidance. It is more of a guidance that we have to give to the market participants. And so, there was a discussion, and everyone, all the 6 MPC members were of the view that we should change it to neutral. So, there was no voting, but the view of all the MPC members is that going forward, the stance should be changed from accommodative to neutral. Manojit Saha, Business Standard: Also, if you can add just one more. Are you satisfied with the monetary transmission that has happened so far? Sanjay Malhotra: I think going by past trends, the transmission has happened much faster. In the money markets in fact, you can see a huge transmission - more than what we have done, more than 50 basis points in the money markets, especially at shorter-term levels. And on the credit side also we are now seeing some initial signs. Deposit rates, in fact have been reduced - retail as well as wholesale by most of the banks, about 40 basis points. The average of course is about 27 basis points, has been reduced over there. 17 basis points is the reduction on the credit side, on the outstanding credit. And in terms of fresh loans, that is a little slow, but it has started, it is about 6 basis points as per data that we have. So, that is slow, but it is much faster than other times. Normally, it takes 6 to 9 months. It has only been 4 months from the first policy cut. So, from first policy cut of 25 basis points, against that if 27 basis points on deposit side, 17 basis points on the credit outstanding side, and 6 basis points on the fresh loans, I think this is a very good transmission. However, we need to do it faster, and that is why we have front-loaded some of our actions. Manojit Saha, Business Standard: Thank you, so much. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Vishwanath Nair from NDTV Profit. Vishwanath Nair, NDTV Profit: Good afternoon, Governor. A couple of questions actually. The first one with respect to your GDP forecast, which has not changed, the estimates have not changed at all. What is the growth boost that you are expecting from this cumulative 100 basis point rate cut that you have accorded, and thereby, would there be a revision for FY 2025-26? And the second part is on the stance itself. I am asking you again, in the past there has been criticism that the stance is more or less becoming meaningless, because we kept saying withdrawal of accommodation, but it was a prolonged pause. Is this a way to then bringing it back into relevance? Sanjay Malhotra: So, your first question is what impact it has on growth. Obviously, it has a positive impact. It will be very difficult to assess as to how this transmission from monetary policy to the credit rates, and then to the real economy, how that transmission happens. As you are aware, it takes a minimum of, going by history, 6 to 9 months. We would like, of course, to expedite it, but we will see impact of this only in the later half. So, for this year, in terms of numbers, especially when there is so much of an uncertainty, we would not be in any position to give you… to what extent it will impact the GDP numbers. On your second question, I cannot actually speak about the past, what has happened, but our policy will be very, very clear, whatever we are saying, we mean it, every bit of it, and you will continue to experience that. Also, to be kept in mind is whether it is past or present or future, a lot of it is dependent on data. So, if the data kind of changes, even if it is say accommodative or tightening, it does not necessarily mean that next policy itself you are going to tighten it or you are going to reduce the policy rate. It does not mean that. It depends on how the data is actually coming in, and what that data is showing. So, if that data demands that you have to actually stay put, even if it is accommodative, that is how it will be done. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next will be Ms. Swati Bhat from Reuters. Swati Bhat, Reuters: Thank you, Puneet sir. Sir, I just wanted to understand, you have front loaded the rate cuts and the certainty obviously helps, but we have seen that despite the massive surplus liquidity that has been there in the market, there is very limited scope to lend, because there is genuine lack of demand from companies and corporates. There is not much capex happening as well. How does this liquidity really translate to boosting growth? What is the advantage of having so much flush of liquidity in the banking system? Similarly, on the CRR front as well, obviously you planned it in advance and announced it now, but CRR historically has been at the 4% sacrosanct level to some extent. Is there a renewed thinking on the CRR front, which is why you have gone ahead and cut it to 3%? Thank you. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Can I just add, nowhere you have told us why you cut the CRR? What was the RBI's thinking? Sanjay Malhotra: So, let me take the second question first. I think the monetary policy statement that I read out, it did mention that it has two objectives. The first objective is that we need to continue to provide liquidity, and I will come to your first question relating to liquidity. And then, we also mentioned that it will not only improve liquidity, but it will also help reduce cost of funding for the banks. So, that is the other objective. And see over the years, last 12-13 years data I have seen, and one can even go back, the CRR has mostly remained at 4%, as you have rightly pointed out. During COVID, we reduced it by 1%. Now these reserves are basically kept for liquidity management. So, the experience as of now, does not suggest that perhaps we do not need 4%, 3% can perhaps suffice. Having said that, we do not know what the future holds. So, please do not hold me to this number that we are going to maintain this 3%, but as of now it seems that 3% is a comfortable reserve ratio to have. And so from a liquidity management perspective, so that is why apart from providing liquidity, it will also reduce their costs and improve their NIMs by about 7 basis points, at least it should help, is our estimate. Why do we provide liquidity? So, that there is a better transmission, there is a faster transmission, and it is primarily basically for that. Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Sanjay Malhotra: We will take the next question. Swati Bhat, Reuters: Sir, liquidity would it actually translate, that bit is unclear. Yes, because so far banks are not lending. So, how does that demand come in? Sanjay Malhotra: See, it will depend. We have said even in the statement that this is not a sufficient condition. Monetary policy is not a sufficient condition. It is a necessary condition; we have provided that. We are confident that it will certainly translate into better credit growth. I am not able to give you a number. Obviously, and certainly with confidence one can say that it will certainly increase the flow of credit. And so that is why this liquidity is important, reduction in repo rate is important. To what extent, and what time frame it will take, that will be difficult to say. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next will be Mr. Ankur Mishra from ET Now. Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Thank you, Puneet sir. Good afternoon, Governor. I want to understand from you that you have given a statement in the monetary policy that today's steps should be seen towards propelling to a higher aspirational trajectory, and you are talking about growth. You have kept your target intact at 6.5%. Is there a scope of further revision ahead, which should be expected with the kind of actions you have taken? And also, I will once again ask on the stance front, but in a cricket analogy if you can explain, it was a roller coaster kind of a policy. The expectation was 25 basis point, you announced 50 basis point cut. Similarly, for CRR, the expectation was 50, you announced 100. But on the stance front, you got back to the crease and said I will wait and watch. So, how should one understand? Sanjay Malhotra: Well put. See the target you are saying, 6.5% is not the target, 6.5% is the forecast that we have made. And the aspiration is certainly much more, between 7% and 8%. We would like to grow as fast as possible. You have said it all. I don't have to say anything more. You have put it out very well, as to what this monetary policy, because everyone here in India, they may not understand our monetary policy, but they will understand the cricket lingo. So, you have put it out very well for your viewers. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now I will invite Ekta Suri from Zee Business. Ekta Suri, Zee Business: Good afternoon. Sir, the policy has been very well received by the markets. However, I want to ask questions which are little different from the market, how they have received it. Sir, my first question would be, in the last policy we had talked about the draft of gold loans. From that policy up to today's policy, you have thought of some changes, because many people also feel that if we are going to keep the gold as mortgage, it is possible that we may not have any proof of ownership, because we may have got it from our mother or someone else or it may not be hallmark. So, such tweaks, you must be thinking of changes in the rules. And second thing also because now we are seeing that foreign banks are very interested in Indian banks. So, with regards to FIIs are you also thinking of some changes in the rules, the 26% voting right though the government has it, or how much stake can foreign banks take in Indian banks? Sanjay Malhotra: Well, you have asked a good question on the gold loan, which was also being discussed a lot. I feel this would be of interest to everyone, so your question certainly is justified. And I would like to tell you, first of all, the regulations on the gold loan that we had issued, they were only drafts, they were not final. I would also like you to know that we have now issued a notice for making a framework for regulation making, which we have informed everyone about through a public notice, that whenever we issue any major circular or regulation or direction, before that we will do two things. The first thing is that we would do consultation. Second thing is we would study the impact of the same. So, considering that we have introduced this regulation about the gold loan. Second thing I would like to inform you that whatever we have introduced, there is nothing new about it, we have only consolidated our old regulations, and we have reiterated the old regulations. We saw that some of the regulated entities were not adhering to the regulations because there was no clarity in that and we informed them about this. That’s why though there was nothing in about but also when we came to know that in black and white, we received comments about that. I think we will issue this today or at the most by Monday. And you talked about the ownership documents (for gold). The draft which we have issued is written very clearly in that if you don’t have the invoice of that then you can give a self-declaration of the same so there was nothing to worry about. We will provide more clarity about the same. Second thing which has come is credit appraisal that there should not be credit appraisal for small loans. That also we are including in this. Those smaller loans up to ₹2.5 lakhs where the collateral comes from the gold, there is no need of credit appraisal. The third one was about end-use that we have to do the monitoring of end-use. There also we have clarified that end-use monitoring will be necessary only when you want to take advantage of that in priority sector lending. Fourth one which was an important question about LTV, we have said that principle of LTV will only be implemented on consumption loans. In everything else you will do credit appraisal, other incomes, other securities according to that if you give more than LTV ratio then it can be given after assessing the repayment capacity. The fifth one and very important question which was related to LTV that we have issued the draft of 75% today, that 75% we are going to make it up to 85% for smaller loan which are below ₹2.5 lakhs per borrower but in this 85%, the interest also has to be included. Earlier it was only 75% of principal and interest which mostly public sectors banks were given at 75% including interest, that is why they were given the principal only 65%, 66%, and 67% but a few NBFCs or other smaller banks were giving 75% principal and including interest especially in bullet repayment loan it goes till 88% because if the loan is of 18% and if you reverse calculate it then it goes to 88%. For smaller loan which are up to ₹2.5 lakhs including principal plus interest this whole clarity we will give it in our circular. We hope that we can regulate this gold loan category quite efficiently. Second question of yours was that are we increase the limit of FIIs or foreign banks so I would to say that already the limit is 74%, 49% limit is on automatic approval route and another 25% through government approval route, so they can go up to 74% so, as of today we are not considering any changes in that. I don’t know where we are getting this question that we are changing this. Related to that only that we are allowing 15% for the non-residents but depending on case-to-case basis it can go beyond 15%. So, there is no immediate change which is going to be there in that. Yes, we have said this much that perhaps you must have seen or heard that this whole ownership structure or the eligibility conditions under which for non-residents it is 15%, we are examining this whole thing. It will not happen immediately. It will take time. These are very deeper questions. If we use cricket analogy, we should not see it as 20-20 match. We will take the decision after considering all the aspects of what is appropriate for our economy because for a common person, he trusts his money with the banks so it is important that that kind of trustworthy owner or manager should be there in the bank. For that, what kind of eligibility criteria we should keep, what kind of conditions we keep for that, we have to talk to everyone because definitely our economy is growing, our economy is getting stronger and we need more banks for that so considering that whatever necessary changes needs to be made we would make. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now I will request Ms. Sangita Mehta from Economic Times to ask her question. Sangita Mehta, Economic Times: Most of my monetary policy questions are taken away, so I am going back to the Annual Report, which was very insightful. It had a lot of data points also. But there is one thing about the Annual Report, where you have said that in FY2025-26, RBI would be considering differentiated regulatory framework for Type-I NBFCs which are without public funds and non-customer facing NBFCs. Sanjay Malhotra: See, it is our policy as far as possible customise the rules, basis the risk profile and so it is only in continuation of that particular policy that mention has been made in the Annual Report. I will request DG in case he would like to add something more to this. M. Rajeshwar Rao: I think review is done as a regular process and Type-I is ones which does not face outside to the system. So, we are having a look at the regulations. That is an ongoing process, we are doing that. Sangita Mehta, Economic Times: This would be kind of new guidelines for this kind of NBFCs on fundraising. M. Rajeshwar Rao: No. Type-I typically doesn't have outside liability, so that it will be depending purely on the internal accruals from them. Sangita Mehta, Economic Times: Are there any new guidelines coming for this Type-I type of NBFCs? M. Rajeshwar Rao: We will review and then see what kind of regulations are needed. Sanjay Malhotra: It means a review will be carried out. If at all there is a need, then we will do it. So, that's the third part of our regulation making framework that we announced. I mentioned about two important elements. Because I answered that in Hindi, I think it is important for everyone to know and understand that we have issued a regulation-making framework now. There are three critical elements in it, one that we will do a public consultation. And when I mean a public consultation, it is not only in letter, let me assure everyone it's not only in letter, but also in intent. So, the important stakeholders, their views we get from all important stakeholders. The second thing is that we will also do an impact, to the extent possible. It may be qualitative - every time it may not be possible to do a quantitative impact analysis what will be the impact thereof on the banking system, on the regulated entities, on the customers, and on all the stakeholders, that is the second element. And the third element is that we will regularly review our regulations, directions, etc., because it is dynamic. Policies have to change with the times and so it is only in that context that we are going to review some of these policies related to Type-I NBFCs. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now I will request Mr. Anup from Bloomberg. Anup Roy, Bloomberg: Sir, Anup here from Bloomberg. Interesting choice of words. Monetary policies left with very little space to support growth. Does it mean that you would expect fiscal authorities to support rest of the growth and your growth aspirations that India should have and also even after all these measures that banks are... Sanjay Malhotra: I believe in doing my work, right and we have done that bit. And obviously it is expected that everyone else will be doing their bit. So, that is not something for me to say, right. It is not appropriate. I believe in doing my job and that’s what we will continue to do. Anup Roy, Bloomberg: Right sir. Sir, one more question. If despite everything that you have done for banks they have ever asked for, banks really do not do the transmission. Can you take actions? Or what kind of actions can you take? Sanjay Malhotra: Ultimately, we have said this in our policy statement also that monetary policy is a necessary but not a sufficient condition, right? So, for monetary policy transmission to happen, there are so many other things, including demand which has to be there and so it will depend on the macroeconomic conditions and the appetite and the demand for credit. Only then it is market forces ultimately- see we have to leave it to market forces. We cannot start regulating that. No, you give credit, or you reduce rates. No, you can't do that. It’s a market. We believe that our markets are deep. Credit markets, there are so many banks, there are so many NBFCs, there are alternative investment funds now vying for credit, there's private credit, and so the market forces will certainly be able to push prices, basis demand for credit. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Hamsini from Moneycontrol. Hamsini Karthik, Moneycontrol: Thank you. Hi, I'm Hamsini from Moneycontrol. My question is with regard to the health of the banking system. Sir, you mentioned in your speech earlier today that you are convinced, you remain quite confident about the health of the banking system. Because one of the private sector banks with where the auditors have recently qualified certain developments as likely to be fraud, has that been escalated to RBI? What sort of actions are you planning to take on that and it's been about 4 months since we saw RBI issue a statement in favour of the bank saying the deposits are healthy. What is your assessment of the picture right now, sir? Sanjay Malhotra: Well, normally we do not comment on individual banks. As I said, the system as a whole banking system is very, very robust. And I also mentioned that these events or episodes I would call them this will happen. They should not bother us too much as long as they are far and few between, and limited. I think the bank has taken enough number of steps to put their, to improve their accounting and other practices. And on the whole, I think the bank is doing well. I will request DG, Mr. Swaminathan, if he would like to throw more, give more details to the extent necessary. Swaminathan J: Sir, thank you. I think you have summed up in terms of what is the current situation as far as this particular entity is concerned. You would recall that in the last MPC press as well, we had said 2-3 things that all of them have been sort of complied with at this point in time. Number one was our priority to have that accounting done properly, accounting for all the discrepancies duly supported by both internal and external audit. And it must be accounted for in quarter four itself. So, that has been accomplished by the bank already. Second, we said that forensic audit and accountability must be held, so that people are held accountable and the examination of fraud has to be completed, and law enforcement should take over from there. So, that has been accomplished already. And third of course, our priority is always to ensure that no customer is put to any loss or any inconvenience. That is something which has been insured and there is no systemic impact arising out of these kind of episodes. And fourth, we have also said that each of this crisis gives us some lessons. So, we sharpen our supervisory tools and we calibrate our supervisory approach basis the lessons that we learned from this, so we are going forward. We will look for these kind of red flags so that we are in a position to anticipate them much in advance, so. The last in terms of succession planning anyway, all of you know that the Board and Management has been chatting with you their updates. So, as the Governor said, whatever that was supposed to play out over the last 3 months has been, is more or less on track. And I am sure that it should be. If not immediately, but at least very soon, it should settle down and then be back to normal, and we will keep monitoring this, not only this but, but the system as a whole. Hamsini Karthik, Moneycontrol: Thank you, Sir. If I can be allowed to ask one question. On the deposit front, a large part of transmission would be dependent on what banks decide on. Sanjay Malhotra: You are taking away someone else's time, so hold on. If your question is not taken up by someone else, then we can come back. Hamsini Karthik, Moneycontrol: Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you. Thank you, sirs. Next, we will have Gopika from Mint. Gopika Gopakumar, Mint: Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, Governor. You have lowered your FY2025-26 inflation forecast to 3.7%. What would be your FY2026-27 inflation forecast? Did you mention it in statement? Sanjay Malhotra: 6.5%, sorry 4.5%. Gopika Gopakumar, Mint: Right. So, you are expecting it to go beyond 4%? Sanjay Malhotra: Yes. Gopika Gopakumar, Mint: And also on CRR, you are expecting it to be staggered from September to November. What is the global situation? I know you are giving a clear indication to the banks, but what if globally, the environment changes, inflation shoots up? I mean if there is some risk. How would you sort of then ensure that the CRR is…? Sanjay Malhotra: We have enough tools. See, CRR is not the only tool for monetary policy or liquidity. You have the OMOs, you have the swaps. And you have the VRRs and the VRRRs so if liquidity has to be managed, which we actually do not today feel that there would be a need to reverse any of those things. We have sufficient tools to do it. Gopika Gopakumar, Mint: Hamsini's question on the private sector lender? How will RBI ensure accountability from the board? So far, we have not seen any action at that level, but don't you think the board is also responsible for what has happened? Sanjay Malhotra: See individual... So, you are talking about the IndusInd Bank, etc. I see the MD, CEO has resigned. And it (resignation letter) says for taking moral responsibilities. So, I thought that should be good enough. Do you expect that all the Board members? I mean, what are you hinting at? I think, you know the MD, CEO, who is also a member of the Board if he has taken responsibility, that is at the Board level itself. Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Sir, sorry for the interruption. Just even SEBI has now issued an interim order saying that there is some kind of insider trading which might have happened and where the notices have been issued. The Bank is claiming that fraud has happened to them. So, I want to understand, sir. Have they reached out to you particularly because they mentioned in the call that they will reach out to the regulator or the investigative agencies due to the fraud scenario. So, I mean this is something which is related to one bank, but it is the system of trust. Sanjay Malhotra: See if there are other criminal acts that have happened then the law will take its course. Please be assured. And in case, the RBI has to step in and take any action, then the RBI will not be failing in his duty. Let's leave it at that. Sanjay Malhotra: No, let's not be. There are other people, you have already asked your question. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you for listening. Sanjay Malhotra: And let's not pre-empt. Let's not pre-empt. And let's not be speculative about it. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you so very much, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Piyush from the Hindu Business Line. Piyush Shukla, The Hindu Business Line: Good afternoon, Governor, DGs. Thanks, Puneetji. So, on unsecured loans, you said the personal loans, the stress has come down a little bit. But MFI stress continue to be present. So, are you looking at taking any other measures to address this? So, there have been a couple of payment banks that had applied for SFBs license, around more than 18 months ago. Then 2 SFBs has now applied for Universal Licence. Is there any timeline sir? In all the other things, RBI has a timeline of approval. So, is there any timeline where you will give the approval. You did not issue any statement on developmental and regulatory policy? Sanjay Malhotra: Three questions you are asking. Piyush Shukla, The Hindu Business Line: This is our clarification. We did not see those response. Sanjay Malhotra: Clarification. What do I clarify if it is not like that? But I will only say this that we believe in actions, we do not believe only in making statements. There is already enough work that we have on our hands. And so, we will first, we will try to because lot of drafts you are aware, you know a lot of drafts are like gold loans you mentioned and there are others. Thank God you are not asking me about those. You are not asking me about those, you know. What about those drafts you are asking me to give more and more and more. So, we will rather be trying to therefore consolidate whatever we have already put in the pipeline, what we have already tried, we have promised and so we do not have to necessarily speak if there is nothing to be, nothing to be spoken, right. What were your other questions? Banks licences? See, I do not think there is a timeline, but it does not mean that we do not have an internal timeline. Let me assure you that work is in progress in all those, all those applications that you have mentioned and very soon you will find our decisions. We have already articulated decision on one of them, which we have rejected, one of them is already rejected. If you are not aware, then let me mention it is already there and the others also we will quickly. Piyush Shukla, The Hindu Business Line: Which application was rejected? Sanjay Malhotra: It will be coming out. As a press release, it will be coming out. You will know. Piyush Shukla, The Hindu Business Line: Today it will come out? M. Rajeshwar Rao: It will come out. But we will try. Piyush Shukla, The Hindu Business Line: MFI sir, will you take any more measures? Thank you. Sanjay Malhotra: There are no specific regulatory measures planned for MFIs. There are none. There is something else related to MFIs, but that is not for this particular purpose. On the supervisory side, if you would like to add anything on the MFI because they have been actually recalibrating their business, we have been engaging with them through supervision. And so if you would like to add on the MFI portfolio that will, I think help. Swaminathan J.: Thank you, sir. But I think that has been already articulated in the MPC statement in itself that the entities that are predominantly in this particular segment has already been identified, recalibrated their business models, stepping up upon their collection methodologies. And you have also seen a shrinkage of that portfolio on account of that because of their recalibration. So, may be over a period of time, may be over the next couple of quarters, this should stabilise like the other two segments also, we saw outlier growth. We took some steps and then it moderated. So, this also should be going forward, but it also depends on the overall economic conditions, income level, because MFI book is to the most vulnerable segment. So, that is something which we will have to bear in mind, give it a little more time for normalizing, but we will keep watching those numbers, but as the Governor said on any none of these segments, there are any regulatory actions or measures that is warranted at this point in time. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sirs. Sir, with your permission last 3 questions. Sanjay Malhotra: Yes. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Ashish Agashe from PTI. Ashish Agashe, PTI: Thank you so much, sir. Sir, this is a follow up to Piyush's question on the unsecured lending bit. So, given that it is an explicit intent to push credit growth, so should we expect some bit of going back on the risk weights order as well of November 2023 and so secondly… Sanjay Malhotra: Whatever had to be done has been done on that account. Whatever was there, see prior to COVID, whatever were the risk weights, some relaxations were given during COVID which were withdrawn. And that's all. If there is any tightening which has happened, that has also been withdrawn. So, there is nothing more on the risk weights. Ashish Agashe, PTI: And sir, following the Supreme Court pronouncement on the crypto matter, has there been some conversation regarding like the RBI stance has been clear from the past itself, but given the… Sanjay Malhotra: There is no new development so far as crypto is concerned. There is a committee in the government which is looking after this. Of course, you are aware, we are concerned about crypto in case because that can hamper financial stability and monetary policy etc. Ashish Agashe, PTI: Thanks. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Shyama from Doordarshan, you may please ask your question. Shyama Mishra, Doordarshan: Namaskar sir. Sir, your docu-series is out, and its good. I want to know that generally RBI is known as conservative. So, this idea of telling your own story, where did it come from? Sanjay Malhotra: I think I will have to ask those people, who were involved in, so maybe DG Rabi Sankar, you can throw more light on how this idea came. T. Rabi Sankar: Yes, this came in the context of the RBI@90 events that we held. As we continued holding those events, and we also held events for international policymakers, other central banks and all that. So, the feedback we got in the process of doing that was that there is a lot of scope for Reserve Bank to convey, particularly to the general public about its functions. General public has an idea of currency, of prices and monetary policy. What we wanted to expose RBI's workings more to the general public and in that context, we thought of this docu-series, the idea of this docu-series is to show what RBI does in a language and visually that an average person understands. Thank you. Anurag Shah, ET NOW Swadesh So, only one episode is out yet. So, how many total episodes are there and why when? T. Rabi Sankar: There are 5 episodes. They will come one after the other, okay? Puneet Pancholy: Thank you. Thank you, sirs. Lastly, we will have Mr. Hitesh from Indian Express. Hitesh Vyas, Indian Express: Good afternoon, sir. Sir, in your Annual Report, you mentioned that one of the agenda for you would be studying monetary policy transmission as part of it, you will be revisiting optimal level of system liquidity. So, what is that liquidity level which you are looking so, that transmission is effective? Sanjay Malhotra: So, the study will look into those aspects. That’s why it's there. And if I knew the answer then it would not be there in the report. The study will go into those details as to what, how the liquidity should be maintained so as to be able to transfer or translate monetary policy into the money markets and into the credit markets. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Hamsini Karthik, Moneycontrol: Governor, my questions have not been asked, therefore, if I can be allowed to ask my question. Sanjay Malhotra: How many are left? Only two? Puneet Pancholy: Sir, there are 3 actually. Sanjay Malhotra: Okay, we take last 3. Hamsini Karthik, Moneycontrol: Thank you. With respect to transmission, much of transmission will depend on how banks look at their deposit rates and where we are today. We have not seen much of a correction on the deposits front. Banks continue to keep deposit rates higher because the fight for deposits is still clearly there in the system. So, how do you expect this particular aspect to pan out, sir? In what sort of transmission do you expect to happen on the deposit side? How soon do you expect that to happen for the lending rates also to recalibrate? Sanjay Malhotra: I think this question was already asked and I already answered it also. But I will still repeat it. See, 27 (bps reduction in deposit rates on average) against 25 basis points cut that we did in February, there is a lag. It will not happen overnight. On the asset side, about 45% of our loan book is linked to external benchmarks, which get immediately transferred. But on the deposit side, there is no such mechanism. Despite that (it happen) and so there is a lag. So, we need to understand as I already mentioned that there is a lag. Despite that 27 basis points, it has already transferred on the deposit side against 25 basis points. Ultimately you see the other thing I mentioned is certainly this will have an impact. It will be with the lag, it will happen. This is what we have seen. Over the past 2 cycles of both tightening and easing that it happens, it happens with the lag of 6 to 9 months. And it will happen even this time around. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. I will request Mr. Lalatendu Mishra from The Hindu. Lalatendu Mishra, The Hindu Good afternoon, sir. Sir, we fought a war with Pakistan last month. There is a ceasefire right now. How is there any impact on the economy during this period after that? Because now both sides have also harden stance going around the world telling our point of views and secondly about COVID, there's some rise in COVID cases. Is there a matter of concern there, sir? Thank you. Sanjay Malhotra: COVID is not a matter of concern as of now. I think it has become one of the viruses. Hopefully, you know it should stay like that. The conflict that we had was or a skirmish or whatever, you know, you may call it. That had a very, very limited, negligible impact on economic activity. Yes, it did have some impact for those days, especially in Northern India. Airports being closed, air passenger traffic did certainly decrease. But it was no major supply chain disruption, etc. So, it does not have any impact on economic activity, growth, inflation. Some few days the prices in those regions, those sectors had gone up, but it's all normalised, it does not have any meaningful, any major impact on the economy. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. And lastly, Mr. Aaryan from the Informist. Aaryan Khanna, The Informist: Thank you, sir. This is Aaryan from Informist. So, this question actually is for the Governor as well as for DG Sankar and Gupta. This steeper yield curve has shown to deter transmission rate cut transmission to corporates in the past. Sanjay Malhotra: What has deterred? Aaryan Khanna, The Informist: A steeper yield curve, sir. Now today is the MPC actions today and the RBI actions today have steepened this yield curve further. So, are there any steps to curb this? And then secondly, in terms of the liquidity management framework, there have been some discussions in the market, any timeline on a draft for that coming up, sir? Thank you. Sanjay Malhotra: See liquidity management framework, there is no timeline that we have, but of course we would like to do it as early as possible. These are intricate matters which need to be understood in detail, because actually in our country the money market is not kind of unified. There are three different markets. The participants are different, collateral and non-collateral. So, from a transmission perspective, therefore, we need to understand these issues deeper. We have been examining this issue, and I cannot give you a timeframe really on this. First on the yield curves, and you can also supplement on the liquidity management framework. T. Rabi Sankar: Yes, as you know, government securities yields are affected by a lot of factors. One of those factors is monetary policy and expectations of monetary policy and liquidity is another factor. But there are also, it depends on demand in particular sectors and so on. Typically, what you would see is that in response to monetary policy, the short end adjusts quicker than the long end. Therefore, when rates are being cut, the curve tends to steepen; when rates are being raised, the curve tends to flatten. That happens, but the market over a period of time, these get adjusted. So, like we said, we do not target any particular rates in forex. Similarly in the government securities yields also, there are no rates, and the market will find its own level. If the market feels it is too steep compared to what it should be, they will adjust that so we would leave it to the market for such adjustments. On the liquidity, I think what the Governor said, we are looking at that once internal examination is over, we will come out with that framework. Thank you. Aaryan Khanna, The Informist: Thank you so much. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. With this, we come to the close of this press conference. I will thank the top management of the Reserve Bank for answering all the questions and making it quite interactive. Thank you all for being here and I wish you all a pleasant day.",

      "summary": "1. Chairman of the Board of Governors, Director of the Institute, Prof and Padma Shree Manindra Agrawal, winner of numerous awards, who was my senior here and who I hold in very high esteem, faculty members, staff, proud parents, family and friends of the graduating students, distinguished guests, and my dear graduating students, alumni, ladies and gentlemen. 2. Today marks the culmination of an exciting chapter for the graduating students, where you have not only learnt new things – academic and extra-curricular – but have also had an enjoyable and memorable experience. I extend a very warm congratulations to all the graduating students. Please give yourselves a huge round of applause. 3. To the parents and guardians, this moment belongs as much to you as it does to your children and wards. Your innumerable sacrifices, continuous support, unconditional love and unwavering encouragement have laid the foundation upon which these young achievers now stand. I know this is an emotional and proud moment for you. I have myself experienced these emotions when my sons graduated – one from IIT Bombay and the other from IIT Guwahati. My warmest congratulations to you as your ward steps into a new chapter in life. 4. Dear graduates, it is a special day for you as you enter a new and exciting phase of life. It is an equally special day for me and doubly so. First, this institute has had a transformational impact on me, my life and my thoughts. I remember with nostalgia my years at IIT. I still vividly remember my first day at IIT when my mother came to drop me with another batchmate. I recollect my days at Hall III and then Hall I, the healthy rivalry between Hall II and Hall III, phatta cricket, bulla, the various celebrations at Red Rose Restaurant on the campus and Chung Fa restaurant in the city, movies at L7, DEC 10 of which we were so proud, the iconic library, Culfest and the many friends that I made and treasure till date. The steel trunk which carried my belongings to IIT and which my loving wife has preserved till date is still with me. I still have my Wilson tennis racket, with which I religiously played every evening at the clay courts on campus. IITK has a special place in my heart. This convocation ceremony is even more special as I did not attend our convocation ceremony; in fact, we did not have a proper convocation ceremony, perhaps the only batch not to have it. So, it’s an honour to be back here after thirty-six long years in a new and privileged role and be a part of the convocation ceremony today. Thank you, IIT, for this honour. 5. Times have changed a lot since I graduated. But there are certainly lessons which endure time. As a fellow-alumnus, roll number 85213, who has experienced life after campus, I will speak about four learnings from my journey. Learning for Life 6. Many of you would have got your dream jobs. Others, who plan to pursue further studies, would get them soon. With a degree from a prestigious institute and a good job in hand, please don’t think that you have arrived. The moment you think you have arrived, you will stagnate. The moment you believe you know everything, you will stop growing. 7. This is just the beginning, only the first step. The degree has only laid a solid foundation and will take you thus far. You will need to build from here. You will need to learn when you change sectors, move across organisations within a sector, take up different roles within an organization and even within the same role in an organisation. Technology is advancing at a lightning speed. What you learnt yesterday would be outdated tomorrow as new ideas and tools emerge daily. 8. I can assure you that the institute has prepared you well for your life ahead. It has not only imparted you with knowledge which will be of immense use but, more importantly, equipped you with the most important tool – the tool of self-learning. 9. Like other IAS officers, I worked in diverse fields like urban management, land resources, industries, power, health, taxation, banking, finance, etc. Many of them were general management but many were highly technical and specialized, which had a steep learning curve. The IITK emphasis on basic sciences and core engineering subjects, its importance to the fundamentals of a subject, its priority to deriving the formulae rather than merely memorizing and applying them, its attention to problem-solving from first principles, and various other methods of problem solving have held me in good stead. IIT gave me the necessary tools for self-learning. I am sure it has given you too the same tools. 10. So, continue your quest for knowledge. Remember that learning is for life. The moment one is not learning, it is a signal that one is not growing; one is not advancing. It is knowledge which will keep you ahead of others. Its importance cannot be over-emphasized. I urge you all, as Stephen Covey said, to continuously sharpen your saw and cut the grass under your feet. Question the status quo 11. My second learning pertains to the period between 2003 and 2006, when I was working in the United Nations. I was managing a project to improve productivity in the hand tools clusters in India. We hired a Total Quality Management expert for some of our interventions. He had long and diverse experience across organisations. 12. He challenged the forging units there to reduce the time taken in changing a die from about eight hours to less than an hour. All of them including the most advanced, productive and efficient forging units vehemently denied the possibility of reducing the time. When he failed after many days of trying to convince them to improve, he suggested some changes including installation of a video camera. This was tried in a unit. These small changes reduced the time to five hours. When asked, the supervisor, apart from other things, explained that the work started on time, as scheduled; no one was late; no one took an unscheduled tea break; all required equipment were pre-arranged and kept ready for use; there was no wastage of time. The small changes and videography did the trick as everyone was being watched. What followed was a series of improvements or what are called kaizens, not only in the exchange of dies, but also various other processes – forging, grinding, electroplating, packaging, etc, as every process was questioned. We ended up reducing costs by about 10%. 13. I learnt to question the status quo. I learnt that there is always scope for improvement. This helped me improve efficiency in various organisations and departments that I worked in. It helped in reducing processing time of files. I reduced turnaround times for applications. It helped me make changes in laws, rules and procedures for the benefit of citizens and government alike, as I questioned the status quo. 14. As Albert Einstein famously said, \"The important thing is not to stop questioning.\" When you question the status quo and ask questions, you open the door to new ideas and fresh perspectives. It is fuel for innovation; it drives you to explore, experiment, and create something better. So, no matter where you are in life or your career, never stop questioning the status quo and improving. Pursue virtuous Karma 15. The third learning pertains to my tenure as Secretary, Department of Personnel in the Government of Rajasthan in 2007-08. Promotions from the state civil service to the IAS were plagued with disputes and court cases. For almost about 20 years, no one was promoted to the IAS. My predecessors did not take up this issue as they thought it would be an exercise in futility as some aggrieved officer will approach the doors of the judiciary. When I was given responsibility for this department, I took up the gauntlet. I studied all the disputes and judicial pronouncements meticulously; decided on claims of seniority and promotion, without fear or favour; finalized and published the seniority lists; and after spending months on this mammoth exercise, sent the proposals to UPSC for promotion. Just when we were about to convene the meeting for promotion, one officer again approached the court and got a stay. Months of my hard work was brought to nought. Even though many officers commended me for the hard work and getting the matter so close to finalization, I was disappointed. 16. I had to leave for Princeton for my masters within a few days and could not pursue the case in the courts. After I returned, I was put in a different department. In a few years, the court lifted the stay. I was asked if I would be interested in giving finishing touches to the work I had initiated. Once bitten, twice shy, I did not take up the challenge this time. The work was completed by another officer. In recognition of his efforts, he was conferred with the state award for civil service. 17. I realized I did not follow my karma as I feared failure. I realized I needed to follow my karma boldly and decisively without bothering about the results. 18. Without going in to details of my journey thereafter, today, as I look back, I can confidently say that it is karma that largely determines outcomes and results. It is the path that one chooses that broadly determines the destination. Today, I appreciate how true Steve Jobs was when he said, \"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.\" Right now, you may not fully grasp how your karma - each late-night lab session, each frustrating bug, and each decision that you take - will impact your journey. You may not appreciate, how delayed gratification, the hallmark of all great leaders, will deliver bigger success over the longer term for the instant rewards foregone. But trust me, over time, the dots will connect and it will be in large measure due to your karma. Trust 19. My last learning is from the student days in IIT, when we were always short of money and under debt. Food at the mess was as good as it can be. We relied heavily on the hostel canteen. A samosa at that time costed 35 paise and a bottle of Thums Up 2 rupees and 25 paise. The canteen was managed by a person called Lala. Lala was loved by everyone. He would serve us till late in night and very generously gave us credit. Even outside hostel, we got credit from the juice vendor, the shops in Shopping Centre, etc. This may not be surprising. Lala knew us, recognizing us as hostelers. Other vendors too recognized us as students from the campus. What was surprising though was that we got credit even from some shopkeepers in Kanpur, who did not know us at all. Why did these shopkeepers give credit to us? It is because of their trust in the IIT students. 20. It is because people do business with people they trust. Trust is the foundation on which any relationship is built, whether it is marriage, friendship, or at workplace - between the CEO and the employees, or between a company and its consumers. 21. It is trust in a person that makes him a leader; it is trust which makes people follow a leader. Integrity and ethics are paramount to develop trust. It is not easy to gain trust. To earn trust, a leader must have the courage to take difficult decisions. He must act in the interest of the employees and other stakeholders. He must be willing to accept responsibility. He must lead by example. He must possess the humility to learn from his mistakes. He must be just, transparent and respectful. Trust takes time to build. But it is easy to lose trust. To be a successful person, a successful leader, graduating students, try to gain trust and having gained it, preserve trust. Your time to shine 22. To conclude, dear graduating students, as you leave this campus today, have confidence in yourself. Dream big, but more importantly, act on those dreams. Make IIT Kanpur proud. Make your parents proud. Make India proud. But most importantly, make yourselves proud - proud by living lives of character, ethics and humility; lives filled with purpose, service and impact. As you step into tomorrow, carry with you the spirit of this institution, carry with you the love of your families, and carry with you the dreams of a billion Indians who believe in your potential. 23. Your journey of transformation began here at IIT Kanpur. Now, transform the world as leaders who are trustworthy; who continue learning for life; who question the status quo and who pursue virtuous karma. 24. May God bless you with all the very best in your journey ahead. 25. Thank you. 26. Jai Hind.",

However, Reserve Bank’s supervisory reviews have indicated divergent practices amongst Regulated Entities (REs) with regard to levy of pre-payment charges in case of loans sanctioned to MSEs which lead to customer grievances and disputes. Further, certain REs have been found to include restrictive clauses in loan contracts/ agreements to deter borrowers from switching over to another lender, either for availing lower rates of interest or better terms of service. Accordingly, as announced in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated October 9, 2024 , a draft circular in this regard was issued on February 21, 2025 for public consultation. 2. Based on a review of the supervisory findings and public feedback received on the draft circular, the Reserve Bank, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21, 35A and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Sections 45JA, 45L and 45M of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and Section 30A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, hereby issues the Directions hereinafter specified. 3.(i) These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Pre-payment Charges on Loans) Directions, 2025. (ii) These Directions shall be applicable to all loans 2 and advances sanctioned or renewed on or after January 1, 2026 . 4. These Directions shall apply to all commercial banks (excluding payments banks), co-operative banks, NBFCs and All India Financial Institutions. 5. An RE shall adhere to the following Directions regarding levy of pre-payment charges on all floating rate loans and advances: (i) For all loans granted for purposes other than business to individuals, with or without co-obligant(s), an RE shall not levy pre-payment charges; (ii) For all loans granted for business purpose to individuals and MSEs, with or without co-obligant(s): (a) A commercial bank (excluding Small Finance bank, Regional Rural bank and Local Area bank), a Tier 4 Primary (Urban) Co-operative bank, an NBFC-UL, and an All India Financial Institution shall not levy any pre-payment charges. (b) A Small Finance bank, a Regional Rural bank, a Tier 3 Primary (Urban) Co-operative bank, State Cooperative bank, Central Cooperative bank and an NBFC-ML shall not levy any pre-payment charges on loans with sanctioned amount/ limit up to ₹50 lakh. (iii) The Directions at paragraphs 5(i) and 5(ii) above shall be applicable irrespective of the source of funds used for pre-payment of loans, either in part or in full, and without any minimum lock-in period. (iv) Applicability of above Directions for dual/ special rate (combination of fixed and floating rate) loans will depend on whether the loan is on floating rate at the time of pre-payment. 6. In cases other than those mentioned at paragraphs 5(i) and 5(ii) above, pre-payment charges, if any, shall be as per the approved policy of the RE. However, in case of term loans, pre-payment charges, if levied by the RE, shall be based on the amount being prepaid. In case of cash credit/ overdraft facilities, pre-payment charges on closure of the facility before the due date shall be levied on an amount not exceeding the sanctioned limit. 7. In case of cash credit/ overdraft facilities, no pre-payment charges shall be applicable if the borrower intimates the RE of his/ her/ its intention not to renew the facility before the period as stipulated in the loan agreement, provided that the facility gets closed on the due date. 8. An RE shall not levy any charges where pre-payment is effected at the instance of the RE. 9. The applicability or otherwise of pre-payment charges shall be clearly disclosed in the sanction letter and loan agreement. Further, in case of loans and advances where Key Facts Statement (KFS) is to be provided as specified in the Reserve Bank’s circular dated April 15, 2024 on ‘Key Facts Statement for Loans and Advances’ , the same shall also be mentioned in the KFS. No pre-payment charges which have not been disclosed as specified herein shall be charged by an RE. 10. An RE shall not levy any charges/ fees retrospectively at the time of pre-payment of loans, which were waived off earlier by the RE. 11. Repeal Provisions With the issue of these Directions, the instructions contained in the circulars/ Master Directions mentioned in Annex , issued by the Reserve Bank, shall stand repealed from the effective date of these Directions. All the repealed circulars shall be deemed to have been in force during the relevant periods, prior to the coming into effect of these instructions.

AePS plays a prominent role in enabling financial inclusion. 2. In recent times, there have been reports of frauds perpetuated through AePS due to identity theft or compromise of customer credentials. To protect bank customers from such frauds, and to maintain trust and confidence in the safety and security of the system, a need is felt to enhance the robustness of AePS. Accordingly, as announced in Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated February 08, 2024 , it has been decided to issue directions for streamlining the process for onboarding of AePS touchpoint operators and strengthening fraud risk management. Detailed instructions are placed in the Annex . 3. These directions are issued under Section 18 read with Section 10(2) of the Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007) and shall come into effect from January 01, 2026.

Definitions I. In these directions, the terms herein shall bear the meanings assigned to them below: Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS): It is a Payment System in which transactions are enabled through Aadhaar number and biometrics or OTP authentication providing financial services such as cash withdrawal, cash deposit, fund transfer, and non-financial services such as mini statement and balance enquiry. etc. Acquiring bank: The bank which onboards the AePS touchpoint operators. AePS Touchpoint: The terminal deployed by acquirer banks to facilitate AePS transactions, which shall include both mobile and fixed points. AePS Touchpoint Operator (ATO): The individual onboarded by the acquiring bank who operates the AePS touchpoint. II. Terms pertaining to Aadhaar, Aadhaar biometric authentication, etc., shall have the same meaning as assigned to them in the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (18 of 2016), and the rules made thereunder. III. Words and expressions used but not defined in I and II above and defined in the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 shall have the meanings assigned to them in that Act. 2.

However, if the due diligence of ATOs has already been done in their capacity as Business Correspondent / sub-agent, then the same may be adopted. The acquiring bank shall also carry out periodic updation of KYC of ATOs. 2.2 In cases where an ATO has remained inactive, i.e. has not performed any financial / non-financial transaction for a customer for a continuous period of three months, acquiring bank shall carry out KYC of ATO before enabling him / her to transact further. 3.
