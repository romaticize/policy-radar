On Young Turks Reloaded, Shereen Bhan speaks with Tara Singh Vachani, Executive Chairperson of Antara Senior Care, a company that's determined to reshape how India thinks about ageing and elder care.She recalls Antara’s early years, battling stigma and misconception, when senior care facilities were perceived as aid to abandonment. But now, the mindset has evolved, especially after the pandemic. “People have started believing in wellness a lot more. They have understood that, as they get older, they need an ecosystem to support them,” Tara shares. Today, 60-year-olds are redefining retirement. It’s no longer just about grandchildren and slowing down. They are embracing self-care without guilt - a shift also powered by India’s economic prosperity, which allows seniors to prioritise their own needs while fulfilling obligations to their families. And while the world is busy trying to ‘hack longevity’, Tara believes the focus must be on living well. As she puts it, Antara’s mission is 'to make the years that you are alive as joyful, as healthy, and as happy as possible'.India is ageing fast. Seniors already account for 11% of the population.
