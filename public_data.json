The Union Minister for Home & Cooperation, Amit Shah, led a consultative committee on cybercrime, highlighting the need for a robust response to emerging threats. Meanwhile, high courts in Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, and Gujarat have issued notices on various petitions, including one related to the non-implementation of the Public Service Guarantee Act in J&K, and another challenging a law allowing police to collect DNA and biometric data of accused individuals. These judicial interventions underscore the ongoing efforts to address governance and law enforcement issues in the country.",
