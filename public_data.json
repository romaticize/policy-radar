      "summary": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBl) has, by an order dated December 4, 2025, imposed a monetary penalty of ₹2.25 lakh (Rupees Two Lakh Twenty Five Thousand only) on The Yavatmal Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Yavatmal, Maharashtra (the bank), for non-compliance with certain directions issued by RBI on ‘Concentration Risk Management’, ‘Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ and ‘Credit Information Reporting’. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Sections 46(4)(i) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and Section 25(1)(iii) read with Section 23(4) of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by the RBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2025. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the bank's reply to the notice, additional submissions made by it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia , that the following charges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: The bank had: sanctioned loans in excess of the prescribed regulatory limit to certain nominal members; and failed to report information on certain borrowers classified as wilful defaulters to Credit Information Companies within the prescribed regulatory timeline. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. (Brij Raj) Chief General Manager Press Release: 2025-2026/1660",

      "summary": "1. The legendary cricketer, the V ery V ery S pecial Laxman ji; Shri P D Singh, CEO of Standard Chartered Bank, India & South Asia, distinguished leaders from across the banking, financial and capital markets ecosystem, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. 2. It is a pleasure to be with you this evening at “Success Through Synergy” . This annual event is an invaluable platform for thoughtful conversations on where our industry is headed. I am grateful for the opportunity to share a few reflections. 3. I am also aware that I stand between you and a celebrity cricketer. So, I will keep my innings brief and brisk, rotate the strike between a few key themes, and then retire gracefully to the dugout quickly so that all of us can get to witness the legendary Laxman play his strokes! 4. We are meeting at a time when banking is being reshaped by powerful forces. Technology is changing how customers interact with financial services. Markets are more integrated, and shocks travel faster. Geopolitical developments, climate risks and cyber threats are adding new layers of complexity. At the same time, India’s economic prospects, digital public infrastructure and entrepreneurial energy are creating huge opportunities. 5. In such an environment, success for any one institution cannot come in isolation. It depends on the strength of the entire ecosystem, and on the quality of collaboration among banks, non-banks, market participants, fintechs, regulators and customers. That is why the theme “Success Through Synergy” is so apt. 6. Since there is a cricketer waiting in the room, let me borrow something from the game. Think of the next part of my speech as an over, with six deliveries. Each ball is one key idea that I believe will shape the future of banking in India. I promise there will be no googlies. Ball 1: New challenges in banking today 7. The first is about the nature of risk. The traditional risks we grew up with, such as credit, market and liquidity risk, have not gone away. In some ways, they have become more complex. Lending is more granular, markets are deeper, and interconnectedness has increased. At the same time, new categories of risk have come to the fore. 8. Technology has blurred the boundaries between banks, non-banks and big tech firms. Competition is no longer only from the bank across the street. It may be from an app that lives on your customer’s phone. Reputation risk has become sharper in a world where information, and misinformation, travel instantly. A single customer complaint, if not handled well, can become a public issue in a few hours. 9. Climate-related risks, physical as well as transition-related, are starting to make impact. Cyber risk is now a permanent feature of bank risk registers. The cost of one major incident can far exceed the loss from a traditional fraud. 10. In this setting, risk management and governance cannot be a back-office function. They are central to strategy. Senior management and Boards have to ask themselves not only “What is our return on capital” but also “What risk culture are we building”. Ball 2: Drivers of customer service in a digital era 11. The second one is on customer service. Technology has given us powerful tools to reach customers, to simplify processes and to make payments and credit more convenient. 12. But the basic expectations of customers remain very human. They want to be treated fairly. They want products that are suitable for their needs, explained in simple terms. They want transparency in pricing and conditions. And when something goes wrong, they want someone to listen and resolve their problem promptly. 13. In a digital, high-speed world, the test of customer service is not only “Did we respond?” but “Did we actually solve the issue fairly and quickly?” 14. Customer service is also about inclusion. The design of products and interfaces must be easy to access, not only to the tech-savvy, but also to those who may be less comfortable with digital interfaces. Ball 3: Innovation and collaboration with fintechs 15. The third point is about innovation and partnership. Fintechs have entered almost every segment of financial services, from payments and small ticket credit to wealth management and cross-border remittances. Many of them have brought fresh ideas, agility and a new way of looking at customer pain points. 16. Banks bring something equally important. They bring trust, balance sheet strength, experience in managing risk over cycles, and deep knowledge of regulation and compliance. 17. The question is not whether banks will “win” against fintechs or vice versa. The question is how we can structure partnerships where the strengths of each are combined in a safe and sustainable way. 18. In cricketing terms, it is like a good batting partnership where both players complement each other, respect the match conditions and run between the wickets with mutual understanding. Ball 4: Customer centricity, grievance redress and cyber frauds 19. The fourth point brings us to a very important issue. Customer centricity is not a slogan. It must show up most clearly when something has gone wrong. This is where robust internal grievance redress mechanisms are critical. 20. Cyber fraud and digital scams have increased, and they can cause real hardship to ordinary customers. Banks have invested in systems to detect suspicious transactions, to send alerts and to strengthen authentication. These efforts are welcome and must continue. But technology alone is not enough. Sharing of fraud typologies, coordinated efforts to take down mule accounts, and working with law enforcement agencies are all important. 21. From the customer’s perspective, what matters is not who is legally liable under the fine print. What matters is whether they feel their bank stood by them in a moment of stress. In the long run, that perception affects trust more than any advertisement campaign. 22. This is where financial literacy and awareness also become part of our agenda. When banks invest in helping users navigate digital channels safely, they are building a more resilient customer base. Ball 5: Data, analytics and responsible use of “the new oil” 23. The fifth idea is about data. It has often been said that data is the new oil. I would add that data is also like water. It can sustain life if used properly, but if it is polluted or misused, it can cause damage. 24. Banks sit on large volumes of customer data. With appropriate analytics, this data can generate insights into behavioural patterns. It can help improve underwriting, detect early signs of stress, and tailor products to suit different customer segments. It can help reduce costs and improve efficiency. 25. At the same time, responsible use of data is essential. Customers must have confidence that their data is being used with care, that privacy is respected, and that there is no misuse or unauthorised sharing. 26. Models and algorithms must be explainable to management and boards, and their outcomes need to be monitored for fairness and unintended exclusion. Both banks and supervisors may increasingly use advanced analytics, but these tools should support human judgment, not replace it. Ball 6: IT resilience and third-party dependencies 27. The sixth and last point is about resilience. As banks digitise more and more of their operations and move to cloud and outsourced solutions, their dependence on IT systems and third-party providers has increased significantly. Outages that earlier affected only a branch can now affect millions of customers. Even planned downtimes need to be communicated and managed carefully. 28. Banks cannot simply rely on the assurance of service providers. They must understand the technology, the control environment and the concentration risk arising from many institutions relying on the same provider. 29. The question is not whether an incident will ever happen. The question is how quickly and effectively the institution can detect, contain and recover from it. Bringing it all together 30. If you look back at these six balls in that over, a common thread runs through them. It is the central importance of governance, culture and people. Technology, data, regulation and processes are all important. But at the end of the day, decisions are made by people, and culture is shaped by the tone at the top. 31. Strong governance, an ethical culture, and a clear sense of purpose are what allow institutions to navigate cycles, absorb shocks and serve their customers and the economy over the long term. 32. As regulators, we see banks as partners. Our role is like that of the umpire: we set and interpret the rules, monitor the game and call out the occasional no-ball or wide when needed, so that the play remains fair and safe. The task of scoring runs, by serving customers well, managing risks prudently and supporting growth, rests with you. 33. Let me conclude with one final cricketing thought. In T20 cricket, it is tempting to go for big shots every ball. In Test cricket, patience, discipline, and respect for match conditions matter more. Our financial system must combine both mindsets. We need the innovation and energy of T20, but we must anchor it in the prudence and resilience of Test cricket. Only then can we build institutions that not only post quick scores, but also stay at the crease for decades. 34. I wish all of you continued success in your journey. May your partnerships be strong, your defences solid, your shots well timed, and your innings long. Jai Hind.",

      "summary": "1. Shri Harsh Bhanwala and other distinguished members on the Board of MFIN; CEO, MFIN, Dr. Alok Misra; Director, Bankers Institute of Rural Development, Dr. Nirupam Mehrotra; esteemed industry leaders, distinguished guests, awardees of the ASCEND programme, ladies, and gentlemen. Good evening. 2. It is a pleasure to join you today at the launch of Micro Matters: Macro View - India Microfinance Review FY 2024 - 25 and the special session on “Microfinance for Viksit Bharat.” My compliments to Dr. Alok Misra and the MFIN team for producing a timely mirror of the sector and a compass for the road ahead. 3. The theme of this year’s review captures a powerful idea: when microfinance is delivered responsibly, it does not remain “micro.” It becomes macro progress. It turns access into livelihoods, borrowers into business owners, and informal activity into measurable economic output. As we work toward Viksit Bharat 2047, the question is how microfinance can contribute most - how we scale its impact soundly, transparently and with accountability. Why Microfinance matters now? 4. Over the last decade, India has laid strong rails for inclusion. Jan Dhan has given households a basic account, Aadhaar has simplified verification, UPI has made small payments instant, and the Account Aggregator framework has the potential to unlock consented cash-flow data. On these public rails, microfinance can travel far beyond traditional branch footprints. 5. This progress shows up in the numbers. The Financial Inclusion Index has moved from 43.4 on March 31, 2017, to 67.0 on March 31, 2025. That is a meaningful shift in access and availability. However, the task now is depth and quality of use. In that context, let me share four reasons as to why microfinance matters. 6. First, it bridges asymmetry. Many low-income households have irregular incomes, thin documentation, and no collateral. Microfinance enables them to obtain small loans, where instalments are aligned to real cash cycles rather than to a salaried calendar. 7. Second, it creates productive capacity. Credit is deployed into inventory, livestock, tools, and working capital. Small assets start generating cash that can service the next, slightly larger loan which can eventually transform a person into a micro-entrepreneur. 8. Third, it serves as a platform for innovation. Assisted digital journeys, Aadhaar-based KYC, alternative credit scoring, etc. were first proven at the frontiers of microfinance. The sector often pilots what the rest of the system later scales. 9. Lastly and most importantly, it brings the benefits of formal finance to those otherwise excluded and help them create a transaction record. That record opens doors to larger formal credit over time and connects households to savings, insurance, and pensions. 10. In sum, microfinance can turn access into use, and use into progress on rails the country has already built. The agenda now should be to convert reach into inclusive growth through better underwriting, reasonable pricing and consistent customer protection. With that in view, let me outline five key ideas that can shape the next phase. Five ideas to shape the next phase 11. Serve the household, not just the applicant: Credit decisions work best when they read the full cash life cycle of the family. It is better to promote a savings habit, a basic insurance cover, and a short emergency line, as all these together can make credit quality predictable. 12. Tech-enabled underwriting with human judgment : Technology can help overcome thin files, but human expert judgment must stay. AI models must be explainable, so review exceptions by a human, and back-test results regularly. The aim is less friction, not less prudence. 13. From mono-product to micro-enterprise finance : Product design needs to match how small businesses actually grow. A single working-capital loan is often the first step; but it should progressively graduate into inventory finance, capital asset financing, and basic payments support. 14. Build climate resilience at the base of the pyramid : Climate is now a credit variable. Districts face heat spikes, floods, or erratic rainfall that strain household income and collections. Lenders have to respond with products that can keep customers and portfolios steady through weather shocks. 15. Responsible use of data : the rails and the data must work for the borrower. Customer data and its privacy is a responsibility. Consent should be clear and in local language, data used for the purpose stated, and storage kept secure. Used well, these rails prevent over-indebtedness and enable responsible personalisation rather than indiscriminate up-selling. 16. Taken together, the aim is to convert first access into regular use, regular use into stable income, and stable income into a clear route to formal credit. This is the quality of growth the sector should now aim for. Regulatory initiatives and supervisory expectations 17. In 2022, the Reserve Bank undertook a careful reset of the microfinance framework. After extensive stakeholder feedback, a revised framework was issued with the overarching intent to expand inclusion, place borrower welfare at the centre, and align rules across all regulated lenders offering microfinance. Along with clarifying what qualifies as microfinance, the framework also removed pricing caps, a long-standing demand of the industry. 18. Greater flexibility brings a higher bar for conduct. The Reserve Bank expects lenders to use the room provided by the 2022 framework in a way that strengthens borrower welfare and long-term portfolio quality. Let me therefore enumerate some of our expectations. 19. Pricing and transparency : Pricing should be reasonable, reflecting cost, risk, and efficiency improvements, and not taking undue advantage of the borrower’s situation. Customers deserve a clear view, which means plain-language loan agreements/contracts that set out instalments, fees, and total cost; and staff who can explain these in local language. Where technology or funding reduces cost-to-serve, borrowers should also reap the benefit. Boards of entities are expected to review spreads against cost of funds and operating efficiency, and to question outliers. 20. Lending should not result in over-indebtedness : A proper assessment should consider all sources of income, recognise seasonal variability, and verify all current obligations to ensure that additional lending does not lead to unsustainable indebtedness. 21. Collections conduct and grievance redress : Outsourcing collections does not dilute accountability. Lenders remain responsible for how customers are treated, including by BCs and recovery agents. Grievances must be easy to file, acknowledged promptly, and resolved within published timeframes. Further, the quality of resolution matters as much as speed. 22. Model risk, analytics, and fairness : Digital adoption is welcome when it improves suitability and reduces friction. Analytics and models require strong governance. Inputs should be documented, and outcomes should be tested for accuracy and unwanted bias. 23. Accurate reporting: Bureau reporting needs to be timely and complete so good repayment behaviour travels with the borrower and lenders can see total obligations of a borrower. Inaccurate or late reporting hurts both households and institutions. 24. Operational resilience and partner hygiene : Resilience must reach the last mile. Cyber hygiene at branch, partner, and device level protects both customers and institutions. Partner due diligence for Business Correspondents and Direct Selling Agents should follow a common baseline that covers training, data handling, and conduct standards, with periodic spot checks. 25. Concentration risk and early warning : Concentration, whether geographic or segmental can magnify shocks. Early warning frameworks that track skip patterns, roll-rates, repeat top-ups, etc. allow timely course correction. 26. Governance, incentives, and culture : Incentives should reward responsible growth, accurate underwriting, and good conduct, not just volumes. Complaint analysis, collections exceptions, and pricing outliers deserve board time. 27. Eventually if industry standards remain high, regulatory or supervisory intervention can stay light. Flexibility and accountability travel together; the sector’s longevity and health depends on that balance. 28. Let me end with a line 1 from Smt. Ela R. Bhatt, who founded SEWA and pioneered the concept of microfinance through women led SHGs in the 1970s. “When we put the human being at the centre, we begin to get a more holistic and integrated view of development. We begin to co-relate our activities with its impact on our own self, on the society we live in, and on the universe we live in. And in this way we restore balance and harmony in the world.” 29. If we stay true to these basics, more first time loan customers will graduate to larger formal credit, and the quality of growth will rise across states and segments. That is how micro becomes macro progress, and how we advance the larger journey to Viksit Bharat 2047. My compliments and thanks to MFIN for this opportunity, to lenders and partners across the ecosystem, and to the field teams who carry this work to the last mile.

      "summary": "Good morning, Dr. Mahendra Dev, Chairman, EAC-PM, Dr. Saurabh Garg, Secretary, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), officers from MoSPI, fellow economists, and fellow policymakers. It is my privilege to be a part of this pre-release consultative workshop. I would like to recognise the leadership of Dr. Saurabh Garg in bringing credibility, ownership, and, may I say, excitement, to the process of base revision of the key macroeconomic data series of India. I would also like to acknowledge the invaluable contributions of the experts, academics, and officials, many of whom are present here today, in this exercise. The data and statistics are public goods. In helping create the revised series, you all are performing an important public service. Our statistical system has a long tradition of professionalism, transparency, and methodological rigour. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), and Index of Industrial Production (IIP) are among the most widely used indicators for decision-making by governments, businesses, financial institutions, and households. Therefore, the base revision of these series is not merely a technical exercise, it is of foundational importance for the wider community. With the economy becoming more diversified and digital, with rising prosperity, demographic shifts, evolving consumer preferences, and deeper financial inclusion, our consumption and production baskets are changing rapidly. But that is not all. Alongside, the ways in which we produce, market, distribute, and finance consumption and investment are evolving too. Global and domestic supply chains are realigning. Savings and investment habits of households are changing, as are the modes of financial intermediation. All of these have a bearing on what we construct and how we construct our key macro data series. In my remarks, I will briefly outline some of the initiatives we are taking at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in order to enhance our own data and statistical offerings, in view of these underlying shifts. RBI’s data offerings can be grouped into three categories. First, as you know, the RBI curates, compiles and disseminates a vast amount of economic and financial data, at frequencies ranging from daily to annual. It is not just an important source, but at times the only source for comprehensive data on banking, the balance of payments, non-banking financial companies, state finances, municipal finances, and the finances of the Panchayati Raj institutions. RBI disseminates these data promptly through press releases, its flagship publications, as well as through timely updates on its data portal, the Database on Indian Economy (DBIE). Second, in addition to such ‘hard data’, the RBI conducts eight forward-looking surveys (four at quarterly and four at bi-monthly frequency) of households, corporates, banks, and professional forecasters, covering areas such as inflation expectations, consumer confidence, and sectoral outlooks. 2 These surveys provide early signals of shifts in economic activity and sentiments. They serve as inputs in the policy deliberations as well as meet the needs of the wider community, even before the ‘hard’ statistics become available. Finally, as a part of its mandate to conduct monetary policy, which under the flexible inflation targeting regime (FIT), is forward-looking, RBI prepares and releases inflation and growth forecasts in its bi-monthly monetary policy announcements. 3 Let me briefly describe some of our recent initiatives in each one of these offerings. Recent Initiatives Pertaining to the ‘Hard’ Data published by the RBI (i) The RBI compiles a large body of administrative and regulatory-reporting data that it receives directly from regulated and other entities. These include information ranging from Basic Statistical Returns, supervisory returns, liquidity and capital adequacy metrics, non-performing assets (NPAs), to high-frequency payments data such as UPI, NEFT, and RTGS transactions. In recent years, as the demand for timely, granular, and user-friendly data has increased, the RBI has intensified its efforts to modernise its data dissemination systems, expand coverage, and enhance the user experience through the adoption of advanced technologies. The Database on Indian Economy , was launched in 2004 as the RBI’s unified data dissemination platform. Over time, the DBIE has undergone continuous enhancements in coverage, functionality, and accessibility. It now hosts more than 2,000 statistical tables, which contain over 20,000 individual data series spanning the real sector, financial markets, public finance, the external sector, banking statistics, surveys, and corporate performance. Since 2009, it has provided near-real-time updates of the Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy through the DBIE, ensuring that users receive the most current information. 4 The efforts to make it savvier, user friendly and extensive are continuing on an ongoing basis. Planned enhancements include a redesign of the underlying data architecture, development of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for automatic retrieval, improved search and visualisation tools, and harmonised user experience across the portal, mobile app and future digital channels. (ii) Data on Flow of Financial Resources and Outstanding Credit to Commercial Sector in India - The Indian financial system has traditionally been largely bank-dominated. Therefore, quite reasonably, bank credit growth has thus far been viewed as a key parameter to assess the flow of financial resources to the commercial sector and its implications for the growth outlook of the economy. However, given the increasing role of non-bank sources of finance, an assessment of the broader spectrum of flow of financial resources to the commercial sector from banks and non-bank sources (including domestic and foreign) has become essential. Against this backdrop, we have started to compile data on the total flow of financial resources to the commercial sector. The non-bank sources include issuances of equity, commercial paper, and corporate bonds by non-financial entities directly in the money and capital markets as well as credit to these entities from non-banking financial institutions. External commercial borrowings and foreign direct investments are additional sources of resources to the commercial sector. In fact, during 2024-25, just a little less than half (48.7 per cent) of total resources to the commercial sector were mobilised from non-bank sources. Given the primacy of this information in assessing overall resource flow to economic activity, starting this month, we have started disseminating two tables, namely , ‘Flow of Financial Resources to Commercial Sector in India’, and ‘Outstanding Credit to Commercial Sector in India’ in the RBI Bulletin. 5 These data will be updated and released in the RBI Bulletin on a monthly frequency from now on. (iii) More timely and frequent Balance of Payments Data - Further, to facilitate the timely and more frequent availability of India’s balance of payments (BoP) statistics, the time lag in the release of the quarterly BoP statistics has been brought down from 90 days to around 60 days beginning from Q1:2025-26. 6 This was achieved by optimising the data reporting timelines and streamlining the internal processes. Going ahead, we will endeavour to prepare and release the monthly BoP statistics ( albeit at a slightly more aggregate-level and at a lag of approximately 40 days). To achieve this, the data processing timelines of various reporting entities are being expedited and streamlined, and further internal cohesion is being established. Recent Initiatives in the RBI’s Surveys Furthermore, the RBI is upgrading its enterprise and household surveys. Enterprise surveys, such as Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS), and the Industrial and Services Outlook surveys are being comprehensively reviewed, as their methodologies have remained largely unchanged for nearly a decade. We are planning for periodic updates to expand coverage, incorporate emerging sectors, refine methodologies, and enhance data quality. Household surveys on inflation expectations and consumer confidence have been expanded progressively to more cities and rural areas over the last two years. However, their broad methodology has remained unchanged since 2018. These surveys are undergoing a fresh evaluation to address the gap between perceived and realised inflation, improve questionnaire design, and explore the inclusion of household panels. 7 Recent Initiatives in our Inflation and Growth Forecasts Under the FIT framework, our mandate is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Because monetary policy operates with well-recognised lags in transmission, decisions taken today affect output and inflation over several quarters. For the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to fulfil its mandate effectively, it must therefore form a view not just of current conditions, but also of where the economy is likely to be in the near-term. Therefore, the bi-monthly MPC resolution provides forecasts of inflation and growth up to four quarters ahead. 8 Any forecasting exercise, by its very nature, has the risk of incurring forecast errors. Such errors are a common feature around the world. These are generally larger when there are unpredictable shocks or events and are larger when one is predicting far ahead into the future. 9 Research has shown that variance across forecasters tends to increase during periods of uncertainty. 10 Inflation forecasting is equally challenging in India, if not more so, given the high and outdated weight of food in the CPI basket and the volatile nature of food prices. Therefore, we take a multifaceted approach in forecasting inflation. This includes (i) using a suite of structural and time-series models, each providing a different lens on the economy; (ii) examining historical patterns in data to identify the underlying momentum in prices, and assess the base effects, which often shape near-term inflation dynamics; (iii) drawing upon a wide range of high-frequency indicators and surveys to capture real-time movements in demand, supply, and their implications on prices; (iv) seeking expert views to interpret turning points, structural breaks, and emerging risks that models alone may not be able to fully capture. We are committed to using the state-of-the-art models and approaches to improve our forecast accuracy continuously. Thus, we have been assessing the appropriate time length that we should consider in our models, ensuring that we use more recent and relevant information than the distant past. We have also extended the scope of our stakeholder consultations, wherein besides, a detailed schedule of existing consultations, we have added a day-long workshop with a rotating set of professional forecasters so that we can learn from each other. Besides minimising the forecast errors, what is equally important is to ensure that there is no systematic bias in the forecasts. As far as the inflation forecasts used in the MPC resolution are concerned, they are unbiased. The recently released Discussion Paper on Review of the Monetary Policy Framework shows that, the deviation of inflation and growth forecasts of the Monetary Policy Committee in India during the inflation-targeting regime does not have any systematic directional bias from the realised inflation and growth. 11 Just as the inflation forecasts, the RBI uses a varied set of approaches to generate its growth projections. RBI relies on a balanced synthesis of robust econometric analysis, contemporary economic conditions, and forward-looking sectoral perspectives in preparing its projections. Among the technical models, projections are derived from a suite of approaches, rather than any single model. These include the benchmark indicator approach, a dynamic factor model, and various time series models for short-term growth projections. 12 Before each Monetary Policy meeting, we hold nearly a dozen discussions with stakeholders from the real sector, financial markets, banks, NBFCs, analysts, and economists. These interactions provide us with valuable insights into their perspectives, outlooks, and forecasts, which inform our assessments. Our periodic interactions with the NSO are noteworthy, as they help in improving the RBI’s methods. Closing Remarks The Indian economy has been a high growth economy that has exhibited both resilience and agility. Our statistical offerings, data and techniques must keep pace with an economy that is growing and evolving rapidly. Regularly updating and revising the existing data series, as well as constructing new ones, is essential to capture ongoing transformations. We all are looking forward to the revised series being prepared by MoSPI. I once again congratulate MoSPI for launching this consultative process and wish the workshop every success. 1 Speech delivered at the Pre-release Consultative Workshop on Base Revision of Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Index of Industrial Production (IIP), Mumbai, on November 26, 2025. Assistance received from Anand Shankar, Somnath Sharma, Dhirendra Gajbhiye, GV Nadhanael, John V Guria, Pallavi Chavan and Tushar B Das, and comments received from AR Joshi, Indranil Bhattacharya and Sangita Misra, are gratefully acknowledged. 2 These include i. Bank Lending Survey ; ii. Industrial Outlook Survey of the Manufacturing Sector ; iii. Inflation Expectations Survey of Households ; iv. OBICUS on Manufacturing Sector ; v. Rural Consumer Confidence Survey ; vi. Services and Infrastructure Outlook Survey ; vii. Survey of Professional Forecasters on Macroeconomic Indicators ; and viii. Urban Consumer Confidence Survey . 3 The Reserve Bank also conducts a bi-monthly Survey of Professional Forecasters to capture the assessments and expectations of economists and industry experts on major economic parameters such as GDP growth, inflation, and external-sector developments including exports and imports. 4 The interface has been progressively refined. In addition, RBIDATA, a mobile application, was launched in February 2025 . 5 An article titled ‘ Flow of Financial Resources to Commercial Sector in India during 2024-25 ’, including outstanding credit to the commercial sector in India for three financial years, viz. , 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25, was published in the September 2025 issue of the RBI Bulletin. Annual data on ‘Flow of Financial Resources to Commercial Sector in India’ for the period 2019-20 to 2024-25 (as per revised format) was published in the Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy 2024-25 . 6 This has been done without compromising the data coverage. The data are released at a disaggregated level as per the IMF’s guidelines. Additionally, the IMF has revised the BoP compilation manual with the release of its 7th edition of the Integrated Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM7) [from its earlier BPM6] in March 2025. With these updates/developments, countries are encouraged to publish their BoP and national account statistics in line with the BPM7 framework. 7 The expected outcomes of enterprise surveys include (i) enhancing the coverage of surveys (ii) inclusion of emerging industry-groups like semiconductors, electric vehicles, Production Linked Incentive industry-groups in the sampling frame (iii) revising the methodology for aggregation of survey indicators (iv) modifying the survey questionnaires, (v) adopting more rigorous data quality checks among others. The expected outcomes for Household surveys include augmenting, rewording, and refining the semantics of the survey questionnaire, and possibility of inclusion of panel of households as part of survey design (based on several rounds of pilot survey) to better capture inflation expectations and economic sentiments of the households. 8 Except in February MPC resolution where 5 quarter ahead projection for inflation is provided along with the annual inflation projection for the next financial year. Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India Act and Monetary Policy Committee and Monetary Policy Process Regulations (2016) requires the RBI to present the projections of inflation and growth and the balance of risks, and an assessment of our projection performance in the Monetary Policy Report, released bi-annually in April and October . 9 Inflation Forecast Accuracy Under High Volatility: Cross-Country Evidence. Box I.1 in the Monetary Policy Report, April 2023, RBI . 10 Uncertainty and Disagreement among Professional Macroeconomic Forecasters, RBI Bulletin, November 2021 . 11 Annex 4: Inflation and Growth Projection Analysis. Review of Monetary Policy Framework - A Discussion Paper, RBI, August 2025 . 12 The use of multiple methods imparts robustness to RBI’s projections. The Benchmark Indicator Approach, which relates to deriving sectoral contributions to GDP as recommended by the NSO, is used to nowcast GDP growth. The dynamic factor model relating to deriving condensed factors from a wide range of high frequency indicators is also used for nowcasting GDP growth. The time series models include ARIMAX model (ARIMA model including exogenous variables), and VARX model (vector autoregressive model including both endogenous and exogenous variables). ARIMAX and VARX models complement each other as the former focuses on a single target variable (GDP growth), while the latter jointly models multiple variables with mutual interactions.",

      "summary": "Prof. Ram Singh, Director, Delhi School of Economics, Prof. Pami Dua, distinguished faculty of the Delhi School of Economics, assembled dignitaries and dear students. Good afternoon. 2. I am pleased to be here at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE) to deliver the Second V.K.R.V. Rao Memorial lecture. The late Professor Rao was not only a distinguished scholar - being one of the first three Ph.Ds in Economics from Cambridge University and winning the prestigious Adam Smith Prize in 1935 - but also an eminent institution builder. He served as member of the Planning Commission and Union Education Minister. For his outstanding contribution to public policy and economic research, Professor Rao was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1974. It is an honour to deliver a lecture in the memory of such a distinguished personality. 3. DSE is an august institution that has made stellar contributions in the economic development of our country. The people who have studied, researched, or taught here have had profound influence in shaping economic policy in India over the years. We, at the Reserve Bank of India too have benefited immensely given that many students have joined the Bank. Many of them have risen to the upper echelons of the Bank’s management over the years. I thank Prof. Ram Singh and DSE for giving me this opportunity to address you all at this prestigious institution. 4. You all have been in my thoughts for the last few days. You are all very bright and intelligent, having got admission to this prestigious institution, through a rigorous selection process. I have been thinking about you because you are the future leaders of our country. I have been pondering about what I should speak to you bright men and women. India looks up to you to shape and influence public policy and economic research in our country, as many of your predecessors have done. 5. Considering the erudite audience, I have chosen to speak on regulation making, because regulations are pervasive. They represent an invisible fabric that enables markets to function, protects consumers, and maintains the delicate balance between innovation and stability. I have structured my speech into five parts – (i) the role of regulation in public policy, (ii) how financial regulation is different and critical, (iii) RBI’s objectives of regulation, (iv) RBI’s key principles of regulation, and finally (v) some challenges in regulation making. I hope this will trigger some interest for research in this area among the students and faculty. I. Role of Regulation in Public Policy 6. You are all aware that while markets are powerful engines of growth and efficiency, they can fail and when they do, the consequences can be severe. Regulations attempt to address market failures caused due to a variety of reasons: information asymmetry, externalities, natural monopolies, systemic risks, and consumer protection, to name a few. Regulation is a pragmatic response to the inherent limitations of unregulated markets in specific contexts. II. Financial Regulation: A Different Paradigm 7. Financial regulation operates in a fundamentally different framework compared to other sectoral regulations. This difference stems from three unique characteristics of financial markets. 8. First, financial institutions are interconnected in ways that non-financial entities rarely are. If a bank fails, it has a cascading effect - depositors lose savings, inter-bank markets freeze, credit supply contracts, and payment systems falter. This impacts the entire economy, which can feed into a systemic crisis. The 2008 global financial crisis in the Advanced Economies (AEs) demonstrated this with devastating clarity. 9. Second, financial institutions are inherently fragile due to maturity and liquidity transformation. Banks accept short-term deposits and make long-term loans. This transformation is economically valuable but creates vulnerability. A loss of confidence can trigger bank runs, converting liquidity problems into solvency crises within days. Unlike a manufacturing unit that can be shut down temporarily, a bank facing a run must be resolved immediately, or contagion spreads. 10. Third, financial markets are prone to procyclicality and herd behaviour. During booms, risk is under-priced, lending standards deteriorate, and asset bubbles form. During busts, credit vanishes precisely when it is most needed. This amplification of business cycles distinguishes financial markets from most other sectors. The procyclical behaviour and its amplification effects on economic volatility are well recognised. 11. These characteristics explain why financial regulation is more complex, and more consequential than regulation in other sectors. It is not merely about protecting individual consumers and promoting efficiency - though these are of paramount importance - but also about safeguarding systemic stability and, by extension, the entire economy. III. RBI’s Objectives of Regulation 12. I will now spell out RBI’s main objectives of regulations. 13. The foremost priority and key objective is to ensure financial stability in the system. Financial Stability is defined as a “condition in which the financial system – comprising of financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructure – is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of financial imbalances, thereby mitigating the likelihood of disruptions in the financial intermediation process which are severe enough to significantly impair the allocation of savings to profitable investment opportunities” 1 . 14. For us in the Reserve Bank, financial stability remains the north star, because we realise that short term growth achieved at the cost of financial stability can have bigger consequences for long-term growth. Research shows that financial instability may not only more than offset the gains of higher short-term growth, but also make recovery more distressful and longer. 15. Although financial stability remains the bedrock, there are other objectives, occasionally overlapping, yet distinct. These, inter alia, include: Prudential aspects, for example liquidity and capital requirements, to ensure safety and soundness of financial operations in the interest of all stakeholders, especially, depositors; Conduct related measures for consumer protection; Assistance in law enforcement, e.g., prevention of money laundering; and Broad socio-economic objectives, e.g., lending to priority sectors. IV. RBI’s Key Principles of Financial Regulation 16. As I mentioned in one of my past speeches 2 , there are five key principles of our regulation making: preference for principle-based formulation; proportionality; consultation; evidence and data-based; and lastly, regular review. Let me briefly touch upon these principles to elaborate their importance. Preference for Principle-based Regulation vis-a-vis Rule-based Regulation 17. First is the idea of principle-based regulation. Principle-based regulation focuses on outcomes. It uses high-level general statements or principles. These principles are designed to be applicable across a wide range of circumstances. It often contains explanations of the intent behind the principle and qualitative rather than quantitative terms. 18. In contrast, rule-based regulation uses specific statements to define requirements that entities must meet. These necessarily focus on specific areas and tend to use quantitative terms. If one was to draw an analogy with parenting, the explicit to-do list made by parents in early formative age is akin to “rule-based regulation” and the broad guidance given as the child grows older is akin to “principle-based regulation”. 19. The global discourse on regulatory simplification, argues for principle-based regulations over rule-based approaches, for simplicity over exhaustive specification., The logic is compelling: complex rules create compliance cultures rather than risk management cultures. They invite gaming and arbitrage. Moreover, they become outdated as markets evolve. 20. Principle-based regulation reduces the potential for ‘creative compliance’, avoids the ‘tick-box approach’, and obviates the need for frequent updations. However, principle-based regulation, while simple, is subject to interpretation risk. Principles without clear standards can lead to inconsistent application and regulatory capture. This may also significantly increase cost of compliance for regulated entities due to the requirement to form their own policies with detailed rationale. 21. We often face a question as to which approach is better. There is no straight-forward answer to this, even though we prefer principle-based regulation. And that’s why you would observe that while we are moving towards a principle-based regulatory regime, most of our regulations are hybrid - a combination of rules and principles. The proposed expected credit loss (ECL) framework for provisioning norms, announced in October this year 3 , is a good example of this evolution. The framework combines principles for provisioning with rule-based prudential floors to avoid misuse and misinterpretation. 22. The challenge for us is to achieve “optimal simplicity” - regulation that is as simple as possible but no simpler, to paraphrase Einstein. Proportionality 23. Coming to the second principle, proportionality, it is an emerging feature of more rationalised regulatory frameworks across the world. Indian financial system comprises a diverse set of financial institutions and banks with varying scales of operation, levels of complexity and extent of risks. It is therefore natural that our regulations are proportionate in measure. The principle of proportionality is like a customised set of risk-sensitive regulations, balancing the costs and benefits based on the risk implication of the institutions concerned. 24. This fundamental principle reflects duly in our policy formulation across and within groups of entities. For example, the idea of proportionality has been embedded in the regulatory architecture for NBFCs in the form of scale-based regulations; tier-based structure for cooperative banks; and higher capital requirements for domestic systematically important banks (D-SIBs). Similarly, proportionality is also reflected in differential treatment of banks as compared to the NBFCs on several parameters including granularity of exposure, liquidity and capital requirements. Proportionality is kept in mind even for differential risks perceived by similar entities, for example, different capital requirements are prescribed for different types of loans and other exposures keeping in view their differential risks. All of these buttresses the point I mentioned earlier that proportionality is a “customised set of risk-sensitive regulation”. Consultation 25. The third principle is consultation. We realise that triangulation is a must. We appreciate that we do not have the monopoly for knowledge. Consultation has been an integral part of our decision making. It explicitly embeds accountability and transparency, which are important to us as a public authority. It bridges information asymmetry. It enables us to look at things through the eyes of others and see many more dimensions. Consultation improves our regulation making. At the Reserve Bank, we have institutionalised this requirement in our framework 4 . Every major regulation is proposed in draft form for public consultation. Evidence-based Approach 26. The fourth element is to make regulations evidence-based, as far as possible. Evidence-based policymaking refers to the method of policy development that prefers facts and credible, relevant evidence, over opinion, intuition, anecdotes and common sense to take decisions. 27. While we may not have at our disposal the rigorous approach of randomised controlled trials, the principle is certainly inspired by it. We try to look for evidence on what works and what not. This may sometimes be difficult and challenging because of non-availability of local data. In such cases, we use international standards, which are customised to our context and conditions. Let me give a few examples of evidence-based regulation making. 28. One, the revised guidelines on project finance, emerged from a careful study of default rates, recovery rates, and the cash flow characteristics of such lending by banks. Two, the increase in the run-off factors for digital deposits under the refined liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirements for banks demonstrates another example of evidence-based regulation. Three, we increased the risk weights on bank credit to NBFCs in view of certain emerging risks in this segment post-covid; these were subsequently restored to original weights, once the evidence suggested so. Regular Review 29. The fifth element is regular review. Regulations need to change when the context changes. However, there is a stickiness to regulation because of regulators’ proclivity to adhere to status quo. A variety of well-recognized behavioural phenomena aid in explaining such a bias: common cognitive biases and risk aversion tend to advantage the status quo. In laboratory experiments, for instance, psychologists find that framing specific options as the status quo result in those options being selected far more frequently than when there is a neutral framing of the options. Banking regulators’ behaviour is no different. Claudio Borio, former senior official of Bank for International Settlements, observed that, “The fear of going against the manifest view of markets can have a powerful inhibiting effect.” The International Monetary Fund in discussing regulators’ implementation of macroprudential policy tools, also notes “biases in favour of inaction.” 30. Roberta Romano of Yale Law School contends that there is an Iron Law of Financial Regulation: following financial crises, Congress enacts legislation that increases financial regulation. She terms them as a regulatory ratchet. You are all aware that the ratchet effect describes a process or an economic phenomenon that, once set in motion, is difficult to reverse, similar to how a mechanical ratchet moves in one direction only. Similarly, Romano contends that new statutes are layered atop existing laws and new regulations are grafted onto existing ones, creating an increasingly complex and opaque regime. 31. This calls for a periodic review of regulations. The FSDC under the chairpersonship of the Finance Minister has decided that all financial regulators conduct a review of all regulations every 5-7 years. We too have started the process. 32. A number of measures 5 that we announced in October, this year are a result of the review of the regulations. Some of these regulations were framed to meet the twin balance-sheet problem post the Global Financial Crisis, in the wake of aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus. The regulatory and supervisory frameworks have been strengthened since then. The performance and health of the banking sector is much improved. As a result, these regulations needed to be reviewed and accordingly they were reviewed and finetuned. V. Challenges in Regulation Making and Enforcement 33. Having covered the main principles of regulation making, I will now describe the challenges that we face in this regard. Creating effective regulation is an exercise in navigating multiple tensions. Let me highlight five of them. Balancing Cost-benefit Trade-offs 34. The first challenge is to balance the cost-benefit trade-off. While regulations do offer benefits in terms of stability, consumer interest, etc, they come with a cost. Economic interest warrants increasing efficiency, and promoting innovation. We recognise that just like there are no free lunches, regulation too is not devoid of costs. There are trade-offs between the benefits and efficiency. 35. We keep this trade-off in mind while formulating regulations. We attempt to strike the right balance, keeping in view the benefits and costs of each and every regulation. This has been embedded in our regulation making framework, which we formalised in May this year. 36. Before releasing draft or final guidelines, we thus try to estimate direct and indirect impact of our proposed regulations. Where exact calculations are difficult, we tend to rely on estimates. This helps us finetune the measures to ensure that cost of regulation is not weighing down the benefits disproportionately. The Boundary Problem: What Should Be Regulated? 37. A subset of the cost-benefit trade-off is whether to regulate or not. Financial innovation continuously creates entities and activities at the regulatory perimeter. Stablecoins, cryptos, buy-now-pay-later schemes, etc. challenge traditional regulatory categories. Should they be banned, tolerated, or brought within regulatory frameworks? 38. This is a deep question, which needs judgment about the balance between potential benefits and risks. The rapid pace of innovation means that this judgement needs to be made continuously so that regulatory approaches evolve and keep pace with the needs of the times. The RBI has not only kept pace with the development but has been proactive in this regard, adopting a balanced and prudent approach. It adopted a cautious approach to cryptocurrencies contrasts while taking an enabling stance towards regulated digital innovations like UPI or digital lending. The Innovation-Stability Trade-Off 39. A related dilemma is how much innovation to permit when its risks are not fully understood. Excessive caution stifles beneficial innovation and can drive activities underground. Excessive permissiveness can allow risks to accumulate and even threaten financial stability. 40. The RBI's regulatory sandbox approach represents an attempt to balance the trade-off - creating controlled environments where innovations can be tested under regulatory oversight before being scaled. However, questions remain about the optimal design of such sandboxes, the criteria for graduation, and the balance between experimentation and protection. Procyclicality in Regulation 41. Fourth, sometimes regulations themselves can amplify business cycles. Emerging markets face particularly acute procyclicality challenges because capital flows amplify domestic cycles. Mark-to-market accounting forces institutions to recognize losses during downturns, potentially triggering fire sales. Capital requirements, if not designed carefully, can force deleveraging precisely when credit is most needed. Provisioning norms that respond to current conditions rather than expected losses create procyclical dynamics. 42. The Basel III framework attempts to address this through countercyclical capital buffers - requiring banks to build capital during booms that can be released during stress. The RBI has implemented these provisions, but there are questions about their calibration from time to time. Regulatory Forbearance vs. Strict Enforcement 43. The fifth challenge every regulator faces is with regard to implementation when strict enforcement of standards seems to threaten broader stability. The temptation towards forbearance - temporarily relaxing requirements - is understandable but dangerous. It can allow problems to fester, create moral hazard, and undermine regulatory credibility. 44. India has grappled with this dilemma. Repeated restructuring schemes for stressed assets and loan waivers, while providing short-term relief, delayed recognition of fundamental problems. The RBI’s shift towards tighter enforcement, including the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code’s prompt resolution provisions, reflects this approach. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted temporary regulatory relief measures, as is the case with trade-related regulatory measures taken recently. These illustrate that context matters. 45. Our approach towards forbearance is clear: forbearance should be exceptional, time-bound, and transparent. It should not become a substitute for addressing underlying problems. VI. Conclusion: Regulation as an Evolving Discipline 46. Let me now conclude. The intent of my detailed treatment of this topic today was to expose you to a relatively diverse set of issues, igniting your interest in the area of regulation making. 47. As you advance in your academic and professional journeys, I encourage you to view regulation not as a static set of rules but as an evolving discipline that responds to changing markets, technologies, and risks. Effective regulation certainly requires technical expertise, but also judgment, humility about what regulators can and cannot achieve, and constant learning. 48. The Reserve Bank of India is trying to continuously adapt. We are vigilant and alert to emerging risks and evolving conditions. We are encouraging innovation while being mindful of our regulatory objective of safeguarding systemic stability. We are trying to simplify regulations where possible while maintaining necessary safeguards. We are strengthening coordination with other regulators while respecting jurisdictional boundaries. We are trying to enforce rules consistently while recognizing that circumstances sometimes warrant flexibility. 49. These tensions cannot be permanently resolved - they must be continuously managed. Managing this requires not just regulators but informed citizens, responsible financial institutions, engaged scholars, and yes, bright students like yourselves who will shape the future of Indian financial system. Achieving good regulatory outcomes is almost always a collaborative effort: by the government, amongst regulators, the regulated, and the broader community. 50. I wish all of you a great success in all your endeavours. 51. Thank you. Namaskar.

It gives me immense pleasure to address this august gathering of distinguished central bankers from diverse regions, expert speakers associated with renowned international institutions and my fellow colleagues from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at this first International Conference on Central Bank Accounting Practices organised by RBI jointly with the SEACEN Centre. I am glad that the topic of Accounting in Central Banks has attracted interest amongst central bankers across the globe and more than 20 countries are participating in this event. 3. The purpose of this conference is to collaborate and understand the diverse accounting practices across central banks, learn from each other, deliberate on certain globally accepted best practices, and improve the transparency and consistency in accounting practices. In my remarks today, I would briefly speak about the unique role played by central banks, importance of their balance sheet and certain accounting practices that influence central banks’ financial statements while sharing RBI’s approach to these aspects. I would also touch upon some emerging areas of discussion in central bank accounting. Unique Role of Central Banks 4. Central banks are unique in two ways. First, they are public policy institutions that operate without any profit motive. Consequently, their balance sheets reflect the policy measures they undertake to address the prevailing economic conditions of the country during a given period. Second, since a central bank possesses the exclusive authority to create money, it cannot go bankrupt in the usual sense. In other words, even if its balance sheet shows losses or negative equity, it can still carry out its functions. 5. Central bank mandates vary widely across jurisdictions, reflecting their historical and institutional contexts. Despite the differences in mandates, functions or roles across countries, at the heart of every central bank is monetary policy and financial stability. Central banks aim to maintain adequate capital and reserves/ risk buffers to be able to perform these critical functions effectively. The Reserve Bank of India has one of the broadest mandates, functioning as a full-service 2 central bank that undertakes a wide range of responsibilities typically associated with a central bank. 6. When it comes to central bank capitalisation, I believe adequate capitalisation is absolutely crucial, particularly for central banks of emerging and developing economies. These central banks not only pursue domestic monetary stability but also play a vital role in managing external sector stability amid volatile capital flows and the spill-over effects of monetary policy shifts in advanced economies. A well-capitalised central bank elevates a country’s standing and supports the resilience of the financial sector. 7. In the absence of any internationally recognised risk capital framework for central banks, each central bank finds its own balance between the opportunity cost of central bank capital vis-à-vis the socio-economic cost and the negative consequences of under-capitalisation. Accounting Standards for Central Banks 8. As widely understood, there is no single globally accepted accounting standard designed specifically for central banks and hence, their accounting and disclosure practices vary considerably in format, depth, and emphasis. While some central banks have adopted the principles set out in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), either in full or with modifications to suit their specific needs, others continue to apply their own national accounting standards or use hybrid frameworks tailored specifically for the central bank. 9. The accounting policies chosen by central banks play a crucial role in shaping their balance sheets. Major areas of accounting policy that have a significant impact on the capital position and income recognition frameworks of central banks include, (i) Revaluation frequency of investments (ii) Treatment of unrealised revaluation gains/ losses (iii) Provisioning methodology/ maintenance of risk buffers and (iv) Surplus distribution policy. A review of publicly available information indicates that central banks represented at this conference follow a wide spectrum of approaches across these key accounting dimensions. These variations reflect differences in statutory mandates, institutional objectives, risk management philosophies, and the broader economic context within which each central bank operates. Accounting Practices Followed by RBI 10. Let me now briefly talk about the accounting practices followed by the Reserve Bank of India. Just to give a context, the entire ownership of RBI remains vested with Government of India. The way RBI prepares its financial statements and sets its accounting policies is guided mainly by the RBI Act of 1934 and the RBI General Regulations of 1949. Over time, within this legal framework, these policies have evolved to keep up with changing needs and practices. 11. I am pleased to say that the Reserve Bank of India has a strong and resilient balance sheet, with adequate level of risk provisioning. Over the years, RBI has consistently worked to align its accounting practices with global best practices, while staying true to core principles of prudence and conservatism. 12. I would like to highlight a few key aspects of RBI’s accounting policy across five crucial areas: – a) Legal Framework, b) Prudence in Accounting, c) Surplus Distribution Policy, d) Strength of Balance Sheet, and e) Disclosures. Legal Framework 13. The Reserve Bank of India Act of 1934 3 lays down two key principles that define how RBI operates from an accounting standpoint. First, it mandates that the issuance of banknotes be handled by a distinct Issue Department, entirely separate from the Banking Department, with its assets used solely to meet its own liabilities. In other words, the assets and liabilities of the Issue Department are kept entirely separate from those of the Bank’s other operations. Secondly, the Act specifies how the Bank’s surplus is to be managed. Once provisions have been made for bad and doubtful debts, depreciation, employee benefits, and other standard banking requirements, any remaining surplus must be transferred to the Government. Together, these provisions lay the foundation for how the RBI manages its balance sheet and upholds transparency in its financial operations. Prudence in Accounting 14. Prudence in accounting reflects in revaluation of the assets at fair/market value, conservatism in treatment of unrealised gains/ losses and a consistent application for recognition of the realised exchange gains/ losses. Over the years, RBI has built provisions as Contingency Fund (CF) and Asset Development Fund (ADF) from realised profits. The Revaluation Accounts viz., Investment Revaluation Accounts, and Currency and Gold Revaluation Account (CGRA), reflect the unrealised gains/ losses from revaluation of investments and translation of foreign currency assets to Indian Rupee. 15. RBI revalues the entire forex reserves portfolio on a daily basis and does not carve out any portion for amortised valuation. All foreign currency assets and Gold are translated to Indian Rupee daily at market exchange rates prevailing on the day, which gets reflected under the CGRA. Domestic securities are mark-to-market on a weekly basis and also at end of each month. 16. As a prudent accounting practice, RBI does not recognise unrealised revaluation and translation gains on securities and gold as income but reflects them as revaluation balances on the balance sheet. On the other hand, any unrealised losses on revaluation of domestic/foreign securities are charged to the Contingency Fund at the end of the year when accounts are finalised. There is no fungibility between the various heads under revaluation, implying RBI prudently provides for any revaluation loss on account of investments and does not offset it with a positive CGRA balance and vice-versa. 17. International practices 4 on these aspects are quite interesting. Some central banks revalue a portion of their portfolio at fair value, while keeping the rest at amortised cost. In some countries, unrealised gains and losses are recorded in the income statement, reflecting their impact on financial performance. This conference would be a good forum to understand diverse perspectives, rationale, and methodology for these classifications from fellow central bankers. Surplus Distribution Policy 18. RBI has a transparent, publicly disclosed and rule-based surplus distribution policy under the Economic Capital Framework (ECF). This framework, introduced in 2018-19, is based on recommendations of an independent Expert Committee 5 . The ECF recognises that realised equity should cover the monetary and financial stability risks, credit, and operational risks while the revaluation balances should cover the market risk. After making the required provisions, the remaining surplus is transferred to Government. Since the introduction of the Economic Capital Framework, Reserve Bank of India has consistently maintained its risk buffers at the prescribed levels, even in the face of unprecedented challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent global monetary tightening. As we strive for continuous improvement and refinement, the ECF was recently reviewed internally 6 , and risk assessment has been made more granular. Strength of the Balance Sheet 19. The prudent accounting policies over the years have ensured that RBI has a strong and resilient balance sheet with risk provisions in form of Realised Equity and Revaluation Balances, currently at 7.5% and 17.4% of the balance sheet, respectively. Hence, with an economic capital of about 25% of balance sheet, RBI is in a formidable position to effectively fulfill its public policy mandates while ensuring monetary and financial stability. Disclosures 20. The central bank disclosures need to strike a fine balance between transparency and confidentiality. They need to be transparent enough to effectively communicate the central bank policy operations and their financial implications, while maintaining reasonable confidentiality of market sensitive information. RBI provides comprehensive and detailed information for each accounting head, along with significant accounting policies, in its Annual Report. Additionally, a weekly snapshot of RBI’s balance sheet, foreign exchange reserves, liquidity operations, and variations in reserve money components and sources is also published. This regular flow of information ensures transparency in communication about our policy actions and the evolving trends in the economy. Emerging Areas in Central Bank Accounting and Disclosures 21. Before concluding, I would like to highlight a few emerging areas in central bank accounting and disclosures which are likely to gain more prominence in coming days. Let me begin with the recent sharp rise in gold prices which has garnered a lot of attention and discussions globally with respect to its impact on the central bank balance sheets. RBI conservatively revalues the gold holdings at 90% of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold price. However, gold revaluation practices vary across countries and the impact of high movement in gold prices on central bank balance sheets and income needs wider discussion. 22. The issue of potential impact of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on central bank balance sheets has also been attracting lot of international research and discussions. Some research papers 7 have tried to explore how the design choices for CBDCs adopted by central banks may shape people’s behaviour with respect to adoption of CBDC and potential substitution of banknotes and/or bank deposits with CBDC. It is also being discussed and debated globally whether and how this may impact central bank balance sheet structures and the need for liquidity operations. 23. These emerging aspects would require ongoing engagement and collaboration in future as central banks learn from their respective experiences. We should work closely in these areas and share our experiences and research with each other, which will help all of us in making better decisions. Conclusion 24. As I end my address, I must say that this conference is being organised at a very opportune time as central banks worldwide are navigating the VUCA world (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous). The diverse and wide-ranging policy actions during the pandemic coupled with differing accounting practices have resulted in variations in reported incomes and balance sheets of central banks. Central bank disclosures have assumed an even more important role in being able to effectively communicate to the larger public the rationale of the policy actions and the accounting policies adopted. In such an environment, prudence and transparency in accounting are not just buzzwords but the pillars which central banks must safeguard. 25. The diversity in the accounting practices across jurisdictions presents enough scope for dialogue and knowledge sharing amongst the central banks on certain common accounting principles/practices which are prudent and can further enhance transparency. This may facilitate better disclosures across central banks within the legal framework of the respective countries. I am confident that this conference marks the beginning of a constructive and collaborative journey towards achieving prudent and consistent central bank accounting practices. Let this be the first step in fostering continued engagement and deeper cooperation among central banks in the years ahead. Wish you all successful deliberations and fruitful outcomes during the conference.

      "summary": "Chair of the event, Shri M Damodaran; Chairman, IRDAI, Shri Ajay Seth; Chairman, PFRDA, Shri S Ramann; WTM, SEBI, Shri Kamlesh Varshney and other distinguished guests, colleagues, ladies, and gentlemen. A very good morning to all of you. 2. I am pleased to be here today for the 10th edition of the Gatekeepers of Governance Summit , as conferences like these provide an invaluable platform for the stakeholders to articulate and understand each other’s perspectives. I thank the organisers for this opportunity. 3. Our theme today is simple to ask but hard to answer: “Regulatory gaps and overlaps: do they exist?” I am inclined to agree that they do exist and I propose to address this in two parts, viz. from the standpoint of organisations and thereafter as Regulators. 4. Most organisations often respond to governance questions by redrawing organisation charts, tweaking reporting lines, and updating committee charters. These fixes do help, but only to a point. 5. Business models, technology, and vendor chains change faster than boxes on a slide. As firms expand, digitise, outsource, and integrate, two patterns keep showing up: overlaps - two teams or two regulators asking for the same thing; and gaps - a new product, partner, or dataset sitting outside or at the perimeter of any policy. 6. If we keep editing diagrams without analysing the root cause, we treat symptoms and miss the cause. In my view, the reason, therefore, is “intent” . When intent is strong and governance is lived in spirit, overlaps simplify and gaps close. When intent is weak, the reflex is to add more rules and procedures – multiplying work but losing sight of the real risk. The real question is how deeply good governance is internalised in everyday decisions and board oversight. 7. With that lens, let me focus on five practices that I feel matter most: Boards must own outcomes, not paperwork. Independence should be in substance. Look through the group, not just the entity. Protect and empower the control functions. Governance gap analysis with real remediation. Let me briefly elaborate on each of these five aspects 8. Firstly, boards must own outcomes, not paperwork . A diverse and independent board keeps an organisation on track by overseeing compliance, risk, culture, and ethics. Directors must exercise their duty of care and duty of loyalty, and they must own outcomes 1 . Boards must set risk appetite and outcome goals, and require independent assurance - risk, compliance, and internal audit - to test what matters and report findings, root causes, and their closure. 9. Secondly, independence is not a label; it is the ability to challenge . It is a posture backed by time, information, and courage. Independent directors should be able to challenge strategy, controls, financials, and risk, and to question the assumptions behind forecasts. Our anonymous 2024 survey amongst boards of banks revealed that many boards prefer consensus, and a meaningful minority of directors hesitate to voice dissent. The Chair’s role, therefore, is to draw out quieter views and keep challenge safe. 10. Thirdly, in large conglomerates, risk does not stop at the boundaries of individual entities . Boards should see the whole, not just the parts. Two steps help. First, ring-fence critical entities so a local problem does not become a group crisis. Second, enforce strict related-party policies. Such transactions can be legitimate, but they need transparency, fairness, and arm’s-length terms. Sound rationale and good documentation are evidence of thought and a tool for future learning, not a bureaucratic burden. 11. Fourthly, the three lines of defence must be real . Business lines own risk. Risk management and compliance provide challenge and guardrails. Internal audit tests the system independently. The Heads of assurance functions (the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, and Head of Internal Audit) must have access to the board and to any business line that can create material risk. They should have adequate budgets and full access to information. Decisions on their appointment and removal should rest with the board. Weak lines of defence are to be seen as a board failure, not a staffing glitch. 12. In an anonymous supervisory survey of assurance heads, most reported strong board backing, but almost half said resources do not match their bank’s size and complexity. It is essential to give assurance heads independence, stature, and adequate resources. Otherwise, assurance stays ornamental. 13. Finally, markets move faster than rules and regulations. A periodical governance gap analysis helps organisations see where their policies and frameworks stand against industry best practices - spotting weaknesses, strengthening compliance, and improving risk management 2 . A system-wide perspective 14. Modern business is not tidy. A listed company can be part of a conglomerate with banks, NBFCs, insurers, brokers, payment firms, tech subsidiaries, overseas arms, and associates. The regulatory map is equally rich: Company law and MCA, Securities regulation and listing rules, Sectoral regulators for banking, insurance, pension, competition law, insolvency, accounting and audit oversight, market conduct rules, data and cyber requirements, and multiple enforcement agencies. Add international obligations, exchanges, depositories, SROs, and state-level authorities. 15. In such a world, some overlap is inevitable. That is not a bug. Overlaps can also act as layers of safety net, ensuring that if one control misses an issue, another may catch it. The real problem, may arise from conflicting rules, duplicated compliance, and uncoordinated enforcement which is avoidable. At the same time, new activities, new technologies, and new business models can fall between the cracks. 16. So yes, both gaps and overlaps exist. The task for regulators is to work together, minimising harmful overlaps and closing material gaps, without impeding innovation. In that spirit, let me offer three principles, may be aspirational in parts, for optimising overlaps and gaps. 17. Firstly, regulators must balance entity and activity-based regulation . Regulate the activity wherever it happens, and keep stronger rules for entities that hold public trust. If an app offers investment advice, the advisory guardrails should apply, even if the provider is not a traditional intermediary. If two activities create the same risk, they should face the same rules - regardless of the label or the provider. 18. The second principle is proportionality . Regulators should scale requirements to risk and complexity. A small, simple firm should not bear the same burden as a large, interconnected group; systemically important players should meet higher capital, liquidity, control, and disclosure standards. Proportionality keeps oversight credible and optimal. 19. The third is to strive towards outcome-based regulation, calibrated to market maturity . Where feasible, make and apply rules to protect outcomes - fair customer treatment, resilience, true and fair financials - rather than locking in processes or technologies. For instance, whether onboarding is on paper or biometric, the test is the same: was the customer identified correctly, and was consent captured? However, calibration matters. Outcomes-based rules work best where supervision and enforcement are strong and markets are mature. Conclusion 20. In conclusion, addressing regulatory gaps and overlaps is a journey of continuous improvement that demands constant reflection, adaptation, and courage to challenge the status quo. When intent is strong, the gaps bridge, overlaps simplify, and governance transcends mere compliance to become our shared conscience. Thank you.

      "summary": "Shri Setty, Chairman, SBI, Shri Amara, MD, SBI, distinguished leaders and members of the financial fraternity. It gives me immense pleasure to be a part of what feels like, and perhaps is, the nerve centre of the Indian financial system. 2. The theme of the Conclave ‘India’s Quest for Self-Reliance in a Fragmented World Order’, makes this event particularly timely and critical. The comfortable assumptions of the post-Cold War era of globalisation are fading as we are seeing a re-emergence of protectionist tendencies and re-shoring of critical supply chains. Economies and societies are struggling to adjust not just to the rapid pace of change of technology, but also as the fundamental nature of technology itself is undergoing a paradigm shift. Technology has always been a catalyst for improving efficiency in delivering financial products, but now it has become the very foundation upon which the future of financial intermediation rests. Technology and Banks 3. Today I want to dwell on a theme that reverberates in the current era of disruptions and fast-paced changes, the role of technology in banking . Every aspect of finance, from payments and credit to savings, investments, regulation and supervision, is already being redefined through technology. 4. With powerful technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing already under way, our challenge is how to embrace them with wisdom and purpose, and ensure that technological evolution is secure, inclusive, resilient, and future-ready. 5. India’s experience in digitisation shows that countries who harness technology with foresight and responsibility will not only adapt to change but shape it. Our uniquely successful model of leveraging Digital Public Infrastructures (DPIs) like Aadhaar or UPI has not only positioned India as a leading example of digitisation, but also it has set an example for other countries to follow. For transformational change, it is not enough that technology is ubiquitous, it should also be foundational. Lessons from India’s Digital Journey 6. If we look back today, we can see that India’s banking system has passed through two-and-a-half decades of innovations in payment technology – starting from ATM networking and moving through a gamut of retail and wholesale digital payment instruments like RTGS, NEFT and IMPS to the game-changing UPI and continuing on to experimenting with digital currency. The journey has been gradual yet, transformational. What are the main lessons that we can glean from this experience that has placed India as a leading example of payments innovation? The very first thing to note is that virtually all of these initiatives came from the public sector, whether it is the ATM Switch, or NEFT/RTGS or UPI or, moving slightly away from the financial sector, the Aadhaar. Even the initiatives to set up key institutions – IDRBT, NPCI, IFTAS, and more recently, RBIH – were all public sector initiatives. The second aspect is that all of these initiatives were by way of creating infrastructures, specifically digital public infrastructures. They were situated in what can be termed a public goods space; they were priced like public goods – minimal charges or free; they were accessible by all, like public goods. Thirdly, these DPIs were made available as a foundational layer for technology firms to create innovation. This gave the Indian approach a uniquely public-private cooperation character, an approach that resulted in the best of both worlds - while the public sector focuses on what it does best – create public infrastructure, the private sector focuses on where it has clear competitive advantage - innovation. Fourthly, open access to DPIs led to a rise of new fintech players such as payment aggregators, PPI issuers, third-party app providers, etc, bringing agility, innovation, and particularly scale. DPI has thus contributed to the growth of the fintech sector itself. Finally, there is a general realisation that the new fintech players, mainly because they had no legacy systems that tied them down, were far more nimble and innovative than incumbent banks. While this did not undermine the role of banks as such, it exposed the Achilles heel of the banking system – that banks could be vulnerable to strong inertia in adapting to new technology. This leads me to the basic theme of my talk – the nature of the challenges new technology poses for banks. Banks and new Fintechs 7. Let me first explain the vulnerability by using the context of UPI. UPI is essentially a payment instrument that transfers funds from one bank account to another (it can also use wallets, but that is a negligible part of the volume, so we will ignore it for this purpose). All UPI transactions are therefore payment transactions made through banks. Yet when we talk of UPI, the first entity that comes to mind is not a bank but a non-bank UPI app. It is well recognized that these fintech entities have taken UPI to where it is today, and that but for them UPI would not have been able to reach the nooks and corners of the country. Acquisition of customers and their payments data, was enough of an incentive for these app providers to extend these services even in the absence of any revenue. It is also important to appreciate that these FinTechs had certain basic advantages - Technology edge – Fintechs are more agile as they have no legacy IT systems, enabling them to use technology that is more conducive to scale up, integrate and upgrade. Banks, with their core banking systems find it difficult to modernise and upgrade. Data advantage - Fintechs can access wider, larger and more comprehensive data sources (for example across multiple banks and spending channels). Cost advantage – With asset light balance sheets, no physical branches and very little due diligence requirements (KYS, AML/CFT etc), these fintechs incur a lot less cost than banks. 8. These advantages were large, and it can be reasonably argued that banks were unfairly disadvantaged (higher regulatory burden, frictions of KYC process and AML checks). In a competitive market, banks would have recovered their higher costs from the fintechs, but then, adoption of new technology would probably have suffered. But even without these disadvantages, it would be reasonable to assume that banks just did not foresee the potential in UPI that the FinTechs did. Part of the explanation lies in the very nature of banks. 9. Banks are special entities, unlike any other business. They have an important socioeconomic role, that of creating money. Because of this role, banks are licensed and closely regulated and supervised. This arrangement works to the benefit of banks, because entry is not free and there is some degree of underwriting by the State. It also has a disadvantage that banks have to bear the cost of regulation, both financially and in terms of the obligation to follow prudential processes. One corollary of this somewhat protected environment within which banks operate is that their innovation edge is blunted. This is probably the reason banks did not fully appreciate the potential benefits of UPI, as keenly as the fintech players did. 10. If this indeed is true, it is time the banking system thought hard and deep about the challenges from the transformational technology changes we are living through. Technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum and digital currencies, will shape the next decade of financial transformation. These technologies pose challenges that are fundamental to banks. Most money in modern economies is bank money. Creating money through extending credit is the most basic function of a bank. The advent of digital currencies is now providing an alternative. We can no longer assume that banks would always remain because who else would create money, that is the lifeblood of modern economies. The risks from private digital currencies to banks appears existential, yet not well understood or debated globally. Even with CBDCs, which become a necessary bulwark against private digital currencies, banking business is likely to change significantly, and these impacts need to be understood by banks. It is not just the responsibility of a central bank, the issuer. Banks are the core intermediaries in financial markets. Every financial transaction, whether or not it requires other types of intermediaries (e.g., brokers or market-makers) would always require a bank to authenticate the payment leg. This is something only a bank could do. With the blockchain technology, this could well change. The basic function of a blockchain is to authenticate financial transactions in the absence of a trusted intermediary. It is now possible that banks may not be required to authenticate payments, substantially impacting their role as intermediaries. 11. Apart from these fundamental challenges, new technology poses various other risks to the roles that banks traditionally play. For instance, digital currencies can provide a superior alternative to banks in cross-border payments. Quantum computing, though nascent, could one day revolutionise encryption, risk modelling, and portfolio optimisation. AI can interpret blockchain data; CBDC can embed smart contracts; IoT devices can trigger automated financial settlements. Together, they signal a shift from a system of intermediated finance to one of intelligent interconnections. 12. The risks emanating from these technological shifts need to be recognized and understood. True, at this stage these risks are more conceptual than actual, yet at the very least they can eat into the exclusive domain of banks. Banks, therefore need to be prepared well to meet these challenges and maintain their central role in monetary transmission and financial stability. 13. While by now banks have a fairly good understanding of how to approach technology adoption, I would only reiterate a few aspects that need to be kept in mind with respect to adopting the new transformational technologies. Banks have inherent strengths - credibility, balance sheet depth and customer base. Technology asymmetry tends to dilute these benefits. The ability to leverage these strengths would depend on the agility and speed with which banks modernize their systems and reimagine their business processes. The nature of technology change facing banks is different. Many technology changes are no longer incremental, they are re-architectural. Platform technologies effectively enable nonbanks to come into the banks’ domain. Distributed ledgers undermine the traditional institutional guarantees that banks provided. Therefore, competitiveness may no longer depend as much on balance sheet strength but on data capability and technology flexibility. Since banks are structurally vulnerable because of their monolithic IT systems and high fixed costs arising from branch network and compliance costs, incremental digitisation is unlikely to be enough to keep them competitive. 14. In this context, what can be the strategic imperatives for banks to prepare for transformative technologies? Modernising core infrastructure to make it less monolithic and rigid is one such imperative if banks have to compete with the fintech ecosystem. Adopting a platform orientation and API based collaboration with fintechs is another. Perhaps the most important requirement is reengineering the culture of innovation within banks and creating incentives for learning and skill upgradation from within. Human expertise to innovate, govern, and responsibly deploy technology remains the differentiator in a digital world. Institutions must cultivate deep digital and data skills at all levels, ensuring teams are equipped to navigate complexity and seize opportunities. 15. Equally importantly, banks need to treat fintechs as partners in innovation and create a mutually beneficial or symbiotic strategic partnerships with them. The objective should be to benefit from the agility of fintechs without compromising prudential discipline. Concluding thoughts 16. As we reflect on the transformative absorption of technology in finance, one truth is unmistakable i.e., while technology is inevitable, its direction is intentional. The choices banks make today will shape not only the architecture of their IT systems but the experience, inclusion, and trust of millions of citizens tomorrow. As technology is rewriting the very DNA of finance, the preparedness of banks will determine whether they lead this transformation or are led by it. Institutions that adopt technology strategically, embed strong governance principles, develop human capital, and collaborate across the ecosystem will not only navigate change but will shape it.",

      "summary": "I am delighted to be here amongst all of you in the SBI Banking and Economics Conclave. I sincerely thank Chairperson, SBI for providing me this opportunity to address the leaders of the banking and finance in the country. This Conclave is happening at a time when we are navigating a world of continued uncertainty, geopolitical realignment, and rapid technological change. This brings not only a host of challenges but also many opportunities. 2. I recall that about a year ago, when I addressed this Conclave in my capacity as Revenue Secretary, I spoke about tax reforms. In my address today, I propose to dwell on the recent regulatory measures the RBI has taken. Earlier, we had issued the Regulation making Framework. We follow a consultative process, do an impact analysis and provide the objectives of the regulations. In the spirit of this framework, I wish to shed some more light on the objectives and the rationale of the major regulations. The Purpose of “Regulation” 3. In this context, I would also like to reiterate what I said in my first MPC statement in February this year. The interest of the national economy demands financial stability. For us in the Reserve Bank, financial stability remains the north star, for short term growth achieved at the cost of financial stability can have bigger consequences for long-term growth. Research shows that financial instability may not only more than offset the gains of higher short term growth, but also make recovery more distressful and longer. 4. At the same time, economic interest warrants increasing efficiency, and promoting innovation, which too is our duty. We recognise that just like there are no free lunches, regulation to enhance stability too is not devoid of costs. There are trade-offs between stability and efficiency. 5. I had assured that we will keep this trade-off in mind while formulating regulations. I had mentioned that it will be our attempt to strike the right balance, keeping in view the benefits and costs of each and every regulation. The recent regulatory proposals strive to maintain this balance - the balance between the drive to innovate and grow and the duty to protect. 6. Moreover, in a rapidly evolving banking system, underpinned by technological advancements of tectonic magnitude, no regulator can afford to situate the system at a point in time. The role of the regulator is to guide its evolution within guardrails that ensure stability, fairness, and resilience. 7. In India, this philosophy has found steady expression in RBI’s approach towards regulation, what might be called responsive conservatism - a model that prizes stability yet remains open to reform. The Backdrop 8. In this context, it would be germane to briefly recap the developments over the past decade in the Indian financial system. 9. Post GFC, in the wake of aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus, the ensuing regulatory forbearance sowed the seeds of the “twin balance sheet” problem - overleveraged corporates and stressed bank balance sheets. Coupled with the manifestation of external sector vulnerabilities, India got clubbed among the so-called “Fragile Five.” 10. Guided by the principle “ never waste a good crisis ”, the period from 2014 led to a foundational surgery to restore the long-term health of the financial system. 11. This was driven by a series of regulatory measures aimed at recognition, resolution and recapitalisation of the banking system. The Asset Quality Review (AQR), initiated in 2015, compelled banks to recognise the true state of their loan books, bringing hidden NPAs onto balance sheets. Significant improvements were also brought about in the supervisory framework. 12. Simultaneously, Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework helped restore the health of weak banks. It was followed by consolidation of 27 public sector banks into 12 by 2020. These measures were complemented by a massive recapitalisation programme, which strengthened capital buffers and restored their capacity to resume healthy lending. 13. The introduction of IBC in 2016, and the pursuant resolution paradigm introduced through out of court workout mechanisms, have fundamentally transformed India’s credit culture. 14. Parallelly, major reforms were undertaken to strengthen monetary and macroeconomic stability, including the adoption of a flexible inflation-targeting regime, deepening of forex markets, and the gradual liberalisation on the capital account. 15. The recent past has also seen structural transformation of financial intermediation into a sophisticated and layered system. Nimble FinTechs and NBFCs now assume a greater role in sourcing and origination. Development of capital markets and credit risk transfer channels such as securitisation now provide a conduit for risk transfers. The Project Finance Directions issued recently, address risks arising from regulatory approvals and availability of land. The proposed forward-looking ECL provisioning will help early recognition of deterioration in asset quality. 16. Moreover, Indian banks today are far more mature than they were a decade ago. To put this in perspective, credit and deposits have expanded to almost 3 times 1 . Capital buffers have strengthened too - the CRAR rose from 13.5 per cent as on 31st March, 2015 to 17.5 per cent as on 31st March, 2025 with CET-1 increasing from 10.43 per cent to 14.73 per cent during the same period. Asset quality has also improved. GNPA and NNPA have reduced to 2.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent in March 2025 after rising to highs of 11.2 per cent and 5.96 per cent respectively in March 2018. Profitability of banks has enhanced significantly. Between FYs 2017-18 and 2024-25, Return on Assets increased from -0.24 per cent to 1.37 per cent, and Return on Equity jumped from -2 per cent to 14 per cent. Regulation cannot ignore this performance, these changed realities. 17. This evolution implies that prudential rulebooks too should evolve in a calibrated manner as banks are now stronger and supervision more alert even as alternative risk-bearing pillars have deepened and market-based risk transfer mechanisms have become more effective. 18. The recent regulatory measures need to be seen in the backdrop of these developments. Let me now elaborate on a few measures. Capital Market Exposure (CME) 19. I will first talk about the draft guidelines on capital market exposure. The proposals to enhance the limits for lending to individuals against securities and rationalise the norms for lending to capital market intermediaries are part of the normal process of review, seeking to reset the limits, set way back in 1999. Importantly, the revision in limits has been accompanied by a more structured Loan to Value (LTV) framework, sensitive to the risks of the underlying securities. 20. The proposed removal of limits on loans against debt instruments, while retaining the regulatory limits for equity instruments, recognises the fundamental difference between the two instruments from a risk perspective. The key risk a debt instrument carries is credit risk, and just like loans, credit risk is expected to be managed as part of the broader credit risk management framework. An additional comforting factor is that only listed and investment grade debt securities are proposed to be permitted as collateral. This rationalisation is also expected to foster a virtuous positive feedback loop for the development of the bond market. 21. As regards acquisition finance, it is acknowledged as an integral element of an evolved financial system, that helps in better allocation of financial resources. Recognising its need, non-bank players such as NBFCs and bond markets are already allowed to provide such funding. Removal of the restriction on banks will benefit the real economy. The proposed guardrails like limiting bank funding to 70 per cent of deal value, limits on debt to equity ratio, aggregate exposure limits relative to Tier-1 capital, and eligibility criteria will contain concentration and credit risks, thereby ensuring safety while allowing banks and their stakeholders to reap benefits of additional business. Market Mechanism for Large Borrowers 22. Let me now turn to the withdrawal of the Specified Borrower Framework. 23. This framework was instituted almost a decade ago, in a very different financial environment. This is a unique measure, which perhaps no other country that has implemented the Large Exposure framework (LEF), at the bank level, has. At that time, the banking system was grappling with elevated levels of stress, which is no longer the case. The tier 1 capital of the scheduled commercial banks has increased 3.2 times from about 8 lakh crore rupees in 2016 to more than 26 lakh crore rupees in the last ten years. On the other hand, overall share of exposure of the banks to corporates has considerably reduced since then. The regulatory landscape, as mentioned earlier, too has evolved significantly. The large exposure framework, which is aligned with international best practices, is now well-established and the supervisory tool kit is vastly improved. Therefore, it is proposed to substitute the blanket risk weights and provisions in the extant framework with better monitoring and risk management by the banks. Reduction in Risk Weights for Infrastructure exposures of NBFCs 24. Coming to risk weights for infrastructure exposures of NBFCs, I would like to highlight that the proposal seeks to prescribe risk weights on the basis of the risk profile of the exposures. However, certain conditions have to be satisfied to qualify for a lower risk weight: one, there is a set of qualitative criteria that has to be fulfilled ab initio, including a suitable covenant to protect the interest of creditors through the tenor of the exposure; and two, a principal repayment criteria that would demonstrate a reasonable performance track record before risk weights can be lowered. Revision in ECB norms 25. As regards, the External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) framework, these measures come against the backdrop of a strong external sector. India’s current account recorded a surplus of USD 13.5 billion (1.3 per cent of GDP) in Q4 FY25, followed by a modest deficit of USD 2.4 billion (0.2 per cent of GDP) in Q1 FY26. Foreign exchange reserves stand at about USD 690–700 billion, sufficient to cover nearly 11 months of merchandise imports. Capital account remains robust. Net inflows to India under foreign investment (FDI and FPI), external commercial borrowings and NRI deposits stood higher at USD 30.4 bn during April-July 2025 than USD 26.8 bn in the same period last year. Our projections show that capital flows will remain quite strong during the rest of the year as well. 26. The recalibration of the ECB framework is a natural step in India’s financial evolution - grounded in strong fundamentals, guided by prudence, and inspired by confidence in the economy’s capacity to engage with global finance on its own terms. 27. The removal of all-in-cost ceilings will encourage competitive rates and promote prudent hedging behaviour. Expansion of the universe of eligible lenders will improve pricing efficiency. 28. Linking the borrowing limits to the borrower’s net worth under automatic route links ECB to the strength of the borrower, while enhancing ease of doing business. This limit and the overall soft ceiling of total outstanding ECBs at 6.5 per cent of GDP will mitigate the risks of excessive external leverage. 29. Moreover, I wish to clarify that ECBs are proposed to be permitted only for FDI-compliant real estate projects and remain prohibited for speculative real estate activity such as land or property trading. Epilogue Appropriate and incremental regulations 30. To summarise, all these measures are balanced and appropriate, built on the bedrock of a banking system that has been systematically fortified over the last decade, with financial stability remaining the unwavering cornerstone of our policy architecture. All the changes are incremental in nature. As Shakespeare would say, we are moving wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast 2 . At the same time when we aspire to become a developed nation, while we move with caution, we need to display courage. Again, I am reminded of Shakespeare’s line 3 : Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but … out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. So, these measures do reflect fresh thinking, but are incremental and do not introduce any sea change. Regulation as a whole 31. Moreover, no regulatory measure can be understood in isolation. Each measure has to be seen in the continuum of regulatory evolution and not in isolation. These proposals must be read against the broader regulatory scaffolding, which mitigates the risks. Together, the regulations create a multi-layered defence, to keep systemic risk in check. Analysing merely one regulation without understanding the complete regulatory landscape risks missing the forest for the trees. Amendments based on experience 32. Let me also highlight that the higher responsibilities placed on the banks are based on their past performance. This is on account of the improved governance and prudent decision-making by the banks over the last decade. As highlighted earlier, capital buffers are stronger, profitability better, and asset quality much improved. Regulation has to evolve keeping in mind the realities of time and the performance of the banks. Promote learning and discovery 33. Moreover, no regulator can, or should, substitute for boardroom judgment, especially in a diverse country such as ours. Each case, each loan, each deposit, each transaction is different, with varying risks and opportunities. We need to allow the regulated entities to take decisions based on merits of each case, rather than prescribing a one size fits all rule. This will enable regulated entities to experiment and innovate, learn and improve. Regulations with guardrails 34. At the same time, wherever we are allowing hitherto prohibited activities, or reducing restrictions, we have provided sufficient guardrails to ensure safety and prudence. Regulation and supervision go hand in hand 35. I may also mention that the role of a regulator is like that of a gardener whose job does not stop with providing the “enabling environment” for the growth of the plants. The gardener keeps on monitoring the growth of the plant and prune unwanted growth to shape a collective orderly beautiful garden . RBI has ample tools - risk weights, provisioning norms, countercyclical buffers - to contain emerging risks. History shows our readiness to act, as seen most recently in the macroprudential measures of increasing risk weights on consumer credit in November 2023. Needless to say, supervisory actions have always enabled effective backstops to prune unwanted growth and shape a robust and resilient banking system. 36. Finally, let me emphasise that most of these are measures are in the form of drafts issued for formal consultation. These have been issued after great deliberation, informal consultation and thought, accompanied with detailed impact assessment, and while they do reflect the broad direction, they are not final. We will finalise them after taking inputs from all stakeholders. Consumer grievance redress 37. Before I conclude, let me also touch upon the changes introduced with respect to consumer grievances. The Reserve Bank has maintained a persistent focus on enhancing customer service standards and strengthening grievance redressal systems. 38. In this direction, the Internal Ombudsmen framework in larger REs is proposed to be improved. The Reserve Bank Ombudsman Scheme is also being further fine-tuned to enhance its efficacy. 39. To sustain the regulator’s efforts, it is imperative that regulated entities address customer grievances through mechanisms that are fair, transparent, timely, and without undue cost. The regulated entities may please assess the quality of customer service through periodic and regular thematic studies. In addition, effective Root Cause analysis of the grievances may also be conducted to identify systemic issues, process gaps and repetitive grievances and remedial measures taken. 40. I would request the MD&CEOs and other top executives present here for their full support and their personal attention in ensuring that the proposed changes, when they are made final, are implemented not only in letter but also in spirit. Conclusion 41. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that our approach is calibrated: granting banks greater commercial leeway for growth, innovation and ease of doing business, while ensuring that risks are minimised and financial stability is maintained. 42. We have set ourselves an ambitious goal of becoming an advanced economy by 2047. The financial sector has a large role to play in it. RBI remains steadfastly committed to this goal. We will ensure that our financial system evolves responsibly to support innovation, growth, and long-term economic resilience. 43. I am sure that the deliberations in this Conclave will help in taking forward this developmental agenda. I commend SBI for this initiative and wish the Conclave a huge success. 44. Thank You.

      "summary": "It is a pleasure for me to be here at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit. I would like to thank the organisers for this opportunity. 2. In my brief comments, I will be reflecting on the observed economic and financial resilience of emerging markets (EMs) in general, and of the Indian economy, in particular. In this context, it may be noted that at the recently concluded Annual Meetings of the IMF, two contradictory themes prevailed: the unprecedented global policy uncertainty; and the surprising resilience of the economies. 2 3. The global economy has shown remarkable resilience to the shifting trade policies and geopolitical tensions. Global growth has held up better than anticipated earlier. Currently, inflation outlooks are mostly benign across countries (notwithstanding the fact that inflation levels in some advanced economies are somewhat higher than their respective targets). Low inflation has provided the headroom for monetary policies to be eased across jurisdictions. Banking sectors across countries are mostly resilient. 3 4. IMF has suggested a few factors that are contributing to this resilience. 4 These include improved policy frameworks in EMs; the tariff outcomes being milder than what were anticipated earlier; and very limited retaliation by the partner countries. 5 In other words, the policy making frameworks in EMs are to be credited for their own economic resilience, as well as for the resilience in the global economy. The key questions of interest, therefore, are: What has made this resilience of EMs possible? Is it here to stay? How well has India done on its policy frameworks and economic resilience? How has the observed economic and financial resilience in EMs been achieved? 5. After completing my Master's in Economics at the Delhi School of Economics and teaching for two years at Delhi University, I joined graduate school in 1993. In my second year, I enrolled in a course on International Finance. The year was 1994 and a balance of payments crisis was unfolding in Mexico, which spread to Argentina and select other Latin American economies, with the risk of far-reaching contagion to many other countries and regions. Despite having witnessed the 1991 crisis at home, I did not have sufficient exposure to the literature on such crises at that time. 6. While taking this course, and subsequently while pursuing my own research in this area, I learnt more systematically about the pitfalls of unsustainable macroeconomic frameworks. These frameworks at that time consisted of: a fixed exchange rate regime which often resulted in appreciation and eroded competitiveness of the real exchange rate and large current account deficits. Premature and rapid liberalisation of the capital account and financial sector, resulting in excessive external borrowing, often in foreign currency (called the Original Sin) 6 . Lax fiscal policy and weak fiscal institutions, which combined with ad hoc monetary policy frameworks and limited independence of the central banks resulted in fiscal dominance and pronounced electoral-fiscal cycles, high inflation, and limited policy credibility. 7 7. It became evident at that time that volatile capital flows, often triggered by external forces, could upend fragile equilibriums characterised by such macroeconomic frameworks. In fact, many more countries, which had such frameworks in place, experienced balance of payment crises in the following years. These included, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines during the Asian crisis of 1997-98; Brazil and Russia in 1998; and South Africa and Turkey in 2001. 8 It also became evident that these currency crises could even engulf the banking sector, resulting in \"twin crises\" with far graver implications. 9 8. In the ensuing years, extensive discussions, introspections, analyses, and research were undertaken within EMs as well as at the multilateral institutions. This culminated in a number of policy reforms undertaken by countries towards sounder macroeconomic management, as they learnt from each other, and were supported by the multilateral institutions. 9. Since early-mid 2000s, EMs have become more cautious in their approach towards the external sector. They have maintained a flexible exchange rate policy (mostly managed floats rather than free floats). They have reduced their liability dollarisation. They have slowed and recalibrated the pace and sequencing of capital account liberalisation. They have built up large foreign exchange reserves to act as a cushion against the adverse impact of external shocks to their balance of payments. In other words, they use their foreign exchange reserves to modulate large fluctuations in the exchange rate, or to meet the demand for foreign exchange emanating from a sudden shock to current account or reversal of capital flows. 10. In addition, they have strengthened their domestic macroeconomic policy frameworks by implementing credible fiscal rules, and have adopted a rule-based framework for monetary policy with inflation targeting or other close alternatives. They have strengthened their banking and financial sectors. Alongside, they have significantly enhanced the independence of their central banks. 11. As a result of these policy efforts, the world for the most part has not witnessed any country-specific or even regional Balance of Payments crises (barring a handful of exceptions) during the last two and a half decades. 10 This resilience has been markedly visible during the last five years when, EMs had to face multiple shocks in succession, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021), Russia-Ukraine war (2022) and other geopolitical tensions, surge in inflation resulting in synchronised monetary tightening by Advanced Economy central banks (2022-2023), and the ongoing trade policy and tariff shocks (2025). The fact that EMs, by and large, are able to tide over these shocks with relative macroeconomic stability is a testament to the success of aforementioned policy efforts. 12. This is not to say that the EMs do not face policy challenges anymore. They do. But instead of macroeconomic stability issues, EMs face greater risks to sustained growth, and meaningful employment generation. 13. Their key challenge lies in finding the new sources of growth. In learning to live in a world in which trade as an engine of growth is faltering, and, therefore, domestic sources of growth need to play a larger role. 14. The acceleration in economic growth witnessed across EMs in 2000s was driven by a rapid expansion in global trade. The ratio of world trade to GDP increased from about 41 per cent in 1994 to 61 per cent in 2008. 11 Since the global financial crisis of 2008-09, however, the global trade to GDP ratio has flattened, reducing the avenues for EMs to grow faster by leveraging global demand. 15. More recently, a new threat to global trade has emerged from the increased incidence of protectionism. Apart from reducing the contribution of external demand to growth, these developments also reduce the impact of potential spillover benefits to domestic growth through channels such as technology transfer. Even as some of the trade relations will be rebuilt and others will evolve during the course of time, the years of hyper globalisation are unlikely to return anytime soon. 16. Neither is the manufacturing sector turning out to be a sure way to economic success (the potential of the manufacturing sector seems to have become limited due to the existing large players continuing to be market leaders). 17. Another challenge, especially for those economies where demography is still favourable, is that under employment remains high, gender gaps remain wide, and a large share of workers remain in less productive informal jobs. 18. For some of the EMs, high public debt is also of concern. Many EMs undertook fiscal consolidation after they were hit by the crises in the 1990s. However, after the global financial crisis, public debt has risen steadily, exacerbated further by cascading shocks such as the fiscal stimulus during the pandemic, and higher interest burden of debt servicing from policy tightening. While there is no imminent risk to debt sustainability in EMs, elevated public debt poses a challenge in financing their developmental goals in the wake of rising interest payments to service this debt. Where does India stand on the resilience of its policy framework? 19. India's policy frameworks have continued to evolve and are currently among the global best. Its exchange rate, that was pegged until 1991, is increasingly market driven. Its external account has been managed well. There are inherent strengths in its diversified balance of payments. On the current account, the merchandise trade deficit has been balanced by strong services exports and remittances receipts. Oil price is not a dampener that it used to be. All in all, the current account shows resilience and is eminently in a sustainable zone. 12 20. The capital account too gets a variety of inflows, including FDI inflows that are traditionally known to be stable; and other equity and debt flows, which are traditionally known to be relatively fickle, but have held up well. India has slowly but surely liberalised its capital account, but the external debt as a proportion to GDP has been low and stable. The ratio of external debt to GDP has averaged around 20.5 per cent in the last 10 years (end-March 2015 to end-March 2025); as of end-June 2025, external debt to GDP ratio was 18.9 per cent. Besides keeping the liability dollarisation in check, India's short-term debt level too has remained low. The ratio of Short-term Debt (original maturity) to total debt was 18.1 per cent as of end-June 2025. 21. India has largely adhered to the path of fiscal consolidation, barring periods of significant shocks such as the pandemic. Importantly, the composition of debt, and the improved quality of public spending has rendered public debt safe. Most of the public debt is long term, is denominated in local currency, and is held domestically (a large part of which is held by institutional investors). Furthermore, a favourable growth and interest rate differential has made current level of public debt sustainable. 13 22. Flexible Inflation Targeting framework for monetary policy, introduced in 2016, was a major structural reform in India. Evidence points towards improved outcomes post adoption of flexible inflation targeting: inflation has become lower and less volatile; inflationary expectations are better anchored; and the transmission of monetary policy has become more effective. Inflation targeting has brought in greater transparency to policy making. Frequent communication has helped in anchoring expectations and in building credibility. There is continuous engagement with stakeholders, making monetary policy a two-way consultative process. 23. As a result of the full matrix of policy reforms, India's GDP and per capita income growth rates have accelerated over time; growth has been among the highest globally; and its variability has declined. 14 24. India's near-term growth outlook is promising too. After growing at a stronger than anticipated rate of 7.8 per cent during Q1:2025-26, various high frequency indicators point towards a robust expansion in Q2:2025-26 as well. In the latest monetary policy statement, growth forecast for FY2025-26 has been revised upwards to 6.8 per cent. Inflation currently is at an eight-year low of 1.5 per cent. As per the latest assessment of the RBI, CPI inflation is projected to be 2.6 per cent for the full year 2025-26, much below the target. Concluding thoughts 25. Having learnt from the crisis decade of the 1990s, EMs have put in place policy frameworks and decision-making processes that have made them less vulnerable to macroeconomic and financial instability. India has been a frontrunner in implementing these reforms. As a result, while the intensity of external shocks may not have declined, the variability of the macroeconomic outcomes has moderated considerably. This economic resilience has enabled the policy makers to focus on reforms to enhance productivity, facilitate ease of doing business, and improve the quality of financial intermediation. Such collective efforts are surely putting India on the path to graduate from an emerging to an emerged market status in the coming decades (and possibly even in the coming years). 1 Inputs received from Asish Thomas George, GV Nadhanael, and Somnath Sharma, and comments received from Indranil Bhattacharya, Anupam Prakash, Sunil Kumar, Sangita Misra and Satyashiba Panigrahi are gratefully acknowledged. 2 We are focusing here more on EMs, not on advanced economies or low-income economies which have their own unique economic features, potentials and challenges. 3 IMF and other multilateral agencies have also been pointing to the various risks that loom on the horizon. They refer to buoyant equity markets (particularly led by technology stocks) leading to worries that a correction could be in the offing. Central banks of advanced economies are concerned about elevated public debt in their respective economies and worry that there might be a disruptive resolution. The financial landscape has undergone significant change over the years, with non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) now playing a larger role in several markets, including the bond and credit markets. The growing size, complexity, and interconnectedness of these lightly regulated NBFIs in the financial system has raised financial stability concerns. 4 World Economic Outlook, October 2025. 5 Adaptability and entrepreneurship of the private sector and supportive financial conditions are the other factors. 6 Eichengreen, B. J., Hausmann, R., & Panizza, U. (2002). Original sin: the pain, the mystery, and the road to redemption. 7 I ended up writing two of the three papers in my PhD thesis on Twin Crises--when Balance of Payments and Banking Crises occur simultaneously and feed each other. 8 These have alternatively been called Currency Crises, Balance of Payments Crises or Sudden Stops. 9 Kaminsky, Graciela, L., and Carmen M. Reinhart. (1999). \"The Twin Crises: The Causes of Banking and Balance-of-Payments Problems.\" American Economic Review 89 (3): 473–500. 10 Frontier markets are not similarly insulated, their policy frameworks not having been similarly evolved. 11 Source: World Bank. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS 12 During the last 10 years, the current account deficit (as % of GDP) remained in the range of 0.6 to 2.1 per cent, barring the COVID year (2020-21) where it recorded a surplus of 0.8 per cent. 13 Another crucial factor is that, of the total debt of the government of India, external debt consists less than 5 per cent, which mitigates the external sector risks (Receipts Budget 2025-26, Government of India). 14 Indian economy grew by an average of 7.8 per cent during the last three years (2022-23 to 2024-25) making it the fastest growing major economy. CPI inflation declined from a peak of 6.7 per cent in 2022-23 to 4.6 per cent in 2024-25. As per the latest available data, CPI inflation was at 1.5 per cent in September 2025.",

I expect an enriching and fruitful discussion on today’s topic. It is of critical importance, as it has the potential to significantly enhance the economic well-being of our people. 4. India is an excellent example of how digital public platforms (DPPs) can impart tangible economic benefits and materially improve the lives of our citizens. I. Digital Public Platforms 5. During India's G20 Presidency, Digital Public Platforms were formally defined as a set of shared digital systems built upon minimal, modular digital building blocks that can be utilized by governments, businesses, academia, and civil society to facilitate society-wide development. 1 6. These platforms comprise open, secure, and interoperable systems that enable access to public and private services. Digital Identity, Payments, and Data Exchange form its foundational building blocks. 7. The G20 also established a comprehensive framework of guiding principles which underpin development and implementation of such platforms including, inclusivity to ensure universal access, interoperability for seamless system integration, scalability for large-scale deployment, security and privacy protection. II. Why Digital Public Platforms matter for central bankers – Economic Resilience as the driving force 8. Digital Public Platforms are of immense importance for Central Banks. 9. Central Banks not only serve as the ultimate guardians of economic resilience. They in many countries, are also responsible for enhancing financial inclusion and for operating and regulating critical payment and settlement infrastructure that form the backbone of modern economies. 10. Digital Public Platforms are an effective tool for achieving these objectives. They collectively lower barriers to inclusion and facilitate access to financial services. As a result, globally, around 865 million individuals opened their first account with financial institutions enabling quicker and hassle-free receipt of governmental grants and subvention 2 . 11. Development of fast payments systems (FPS) aligns with key public policy objectives, including creation of safe and efficient payment systems for everyone, reducing cash dependence, and supporting digitalisation. FPS continue to grow in both number and usage, having been established in more than 70 jurisdictions across the world. III. India as a case study in inclusive, secure, and scalable DPPs 12. India's Digital Public Platforms constitute a well-structured, multi-layered system of interconnected digital building blocks including digital identity through Aadhaar, instant payment systems via the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and secure data sharing through the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA). 13. For us, the guiding principle has been to build such platforms in the public sector as a public good with suitable guardrails, and without a profit motive. Public and private sector entities can then leverage on these platforms to quickly develop applications across credit, health, social protection, agriculture, and several other domains. 14. While the public sector establishes the foundational infrastructure layer, the success of Digital Public Platforms is bolstered by active private sector participation. Private sector engagement drives innovation and enhances competition, thereby elevating service quality and user experience. 15. Further, the private sector plays a vital role in innovating and nurturing vibrant developer communities and expanding digital markets. All of these contribute to the maturity of the ecosystem around the DPPs while maintaining the core principles of accessibility, inclusivity, and public benefit. 16. This approach has resulted in significant positive externalities for growth and development of digital payment systems in India. I will highlight a few initiatives taken by India to build such platforms. 17. I will start with Aadhaar, the unique identity platform. It is the very basic fundamental block for any digitalisation effort in a country. Aadhaar today has over 1.3 billion users. Using this identify platform, over 566 million bank accounts have been opened, 316 million of these belong to women. This has provided a significant fillip to financial inclusion initiatives. 18. It has also enabled direct benefit transfers (DBT) bypassing cash-based subsidy distribution and crediting subsidies directly into bank accounts. Over 500 billion USD have been transferred directly to beneficiaries, significantly reducing fraud and leakage. 19. Coming to payments, the Unified Payments Interface or UPI is another critical Digital Public Platform. It has transformed the payments landscape. It enables transfer of payments in real time, efficiently from one account to another across banks. 20. Around 85% of the digital payment transactions in India today are carried out through UPI. About 20 billion transactions are made using UPI every month, representing value equivalent to over 280 billion USD. 21. UPI is a powerful catalyst, accelerating financial inclusion. Small vendors and micro enterprises can now accept payments digitally, and build financial history, thereby enabling access to formal credit at much lower costs. 22. There are other benefits too. A recent research study on the impact of UPI suggests that higher UPI adoption is associated with lower cash demand 3 . Another study shows that a one percent increase in UPI transaction volumes correlates with a 0.03 percent increase in GDP growth 4 . 23. Digital payment systems have decreased delivery costs, minimised revenue leakages, and facilitated rapid deployment of emergency relief programmes, particularly during the global COVID-19 pandemic. IV. International Cooperation 24. We believe that the benefits of DPPs should be available to the whole world, in the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, which means, ‘the world is one family’. This was also the theme of India’s G20 presidency. We are fully committed to international collaboration around such platforms. 25. In the spirit of this collaboration, India developed the Modular Open-Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) 5 for digital identity. This free, secure, and scalable platform allows other countries to build their own national digital ID systems. 27 countries are currently either adopting or considering MOSIP-based systems, to deliver essential services quickly, directly, and seamlessly to their citizens. 26. For collaboration in digital payments, we have adopted three strategic approaches: (i) One, we are linking UPI with fast payment systems of other countries for cross-border remittances. Linkage between India and Singapore (UPI-PayNow) is live. Work is under progress with a few other countries bilaterally as well as multilaterally. (ii) Two, we are enabling cross-border merchant (P2M) payments through UPI via QR codes at merchant locations in both offline and e-commerce mode. This is already live in a few countries and work is in progress for enabling merchant payments in a few more countries. (iii) Three, we are supporting deployment of UPI-like sovereign payment rails or upgrading existing systems in partner countries using UPI technology stack, while agreement/MoU have been signed for deployment in a few more countries. 27. These efforts will also promote cross-border trade and payments, while encouraging efficiency, improving customer experience, and reducing cost. Concluding remarks 28. To conclude, Digital Public Platforms have proved to be central to inclusive growth in India. Their impact on welfare transfers, democratisation of payments and deepening of financial inclusion has, indeed, been transformative. We are committed to share our model to help countries accelerate digital transformation. I am confident that we can work together to empower our citizens through Digital Public Platforms.

Since then, the market for interest rate derivatives has developed with the availability of a larger bouquet of IRD products and increasing participation by residents and non-residents. A growing reliance of the financial system on market-based finance and external benchmarking of loans also necessitates a more developed IRD market. Accordingly, a comprehensive review of the Directions was undertaken and the draft Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Rupee Interest Rate Derivatives) Directions, 2025 was published on June 16, 2025, seeking feedback from stakeholders. The Master Direction updates the regulatory framework for IRD in line with developments in the IRD market and with a view to support the risk management needs of the broader financial system. It also aims at fostering greater transparency in the Rupee IRD market. 2. The feedback received on the draft has been examined and consequent modifications have been suitably incorporated in the final Master Direction. Statement on the major feedback received is provided in the Annex . The final Master Direction is being issued today . (Brij Raj) Chief General Manager Press Release: 2025-2026/1661",
