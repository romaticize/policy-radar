      "summary": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBl) has, by an order dated October 14, 2025, imposed a monetary penalty of ₹8 lakh (Rupees Eight Lakh only) on Latur District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd., Maharashtra (the bank), for contravention of provisions of Section 20 read with Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act) and non-compliance with certain directions issued by RBI on ‘Know Your Customers (KYC) ’. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) and Section 46(4)(i) read with Section 56 of the BR Act. The statutory inspection of the bank was conducted by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of contravention of statutory provisions / non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said provisions and directions. After considering the bank's reply to the notice, additional submissions made by it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charges against the bank were sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: The bank had: sanctioned and renewed certain director related loans; and failed to upload the KYC records of certain customers onto Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCR) within the prescribed timeline. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the bank. (Brij Raj) Chief General Manager Press Release: 2025-2026/1450",

      "summary": "It is a pleasure for me to be here at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit. I would like to thank the organisers for this opportunity. 2. In my brief comments, I will be reflecting on the observed economic and financial resilience of emerging markets (EMs) in general, and of the Indian economy, in particular. In this context, it may be noted that at the recently concluded Annual Meetings of the IMF, two contradictory themes prevailed: the unprecedented global policy uncertainty; and the surprising resilience of the economies. 2 3. The global economy has shown remarkable resilience to the shifting trade policies and geopolitical tensions. Global growth has held up better than anticipated earlier. Currently, inflation outlooks are mostly benign across countries (notwithstanding the fact that inflation levels in some advanced economies are somewhat higher than their respective targets). Low inflation has provided the headroom for monetary policies to be eased across jurisdictions. Banking sectors across countries are mostly resilient. 3 4. IMF has suggested a few factors that are contributing to this resilience. 4 These include improved policy frameworks in EMs; the tariff outcomes being milder than what were anticipated earlier; and very limited retaliation by the partner countries. 5 In other words, the policy making frameworks in EMs are to be credited for their own economic resilience, as well as for the resilience in the global economy. The key questions of interest, therefore, are: What has made this resilience of EMs possible? Is it here to stay? How well has India done on its policy frameworks and economic resilience? How has the observed economic and financial resilience in EMs been achieved? 5. After completing my Master's in Economics at the Delhi School of Economics and teaching for two years at Delhi University, I joined graduate school in 1993. In my second year, I enrolled in a course on International Finance. The year was 1994 and a balance of payments crisis was unfolding in Mexico, which spread to Argentina and select other Latin American economies, with the risk of far-reaching contagion to many other countries and regions. Despite having witnessed the 1991 crisis at home, I did not have sufficient exposure to the literature on such crises at that time. 6. While taking this course, and subsequently while pursuing my own research in this area, I learnt more systematically about the pitfalls of unsustainable macroeconomic frameworks. These frameworks at that time consisted of: a fixed exchange rate regime which often resulted in appreciation and eroded competitiveness of the real exchange rate and large current account deficits. Premature and rapid liberalisation of the capital account and financial sector, resulting in excessive external borrowing, often in foreign currency (called the Original Sin) 6 . Lax fiscal policy and weak fiscal institutions, which combined with ad hoc monetary policy frameworks and limited independence of the central banks resulted in fiscal dominance and pronounced electoral-fiscal cycles, high inflation, and limited policy credibility. 7 7. It became evident at that time that volatile capital flows, often triggered by external forces, could upend fragile equilibriums characterised by such macroeconomic frameworks. In fact, many more countries, which had such frameworks in place, experienced balance of payment crises in the following years. These included, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines during the Asian crisis of 1997-98; Brazil and Russia in 1998; and South Africa and Turkey in 2001. 8 It also became evident that these currency crises could even engulf the banking sector, resulting in \"twin crises\" with far graver implications. 9 8. In the ensuing years, extensive discussions, introspections, analyses, and research were undertaken within EMs as well as at the multilateral institutions. This culminated in a number of policy reforms undertaken by countries towards sounder macroeconomic management, as they learnt from each other, and were supported by the multilateral institutions. 9. Since early-mid 2000s, EMs have become more cautious in their approach towards the external sector. They have maintained a flexible exchange rate policy (mostly managed floats rather than free floats). They have reduced their liability dollarisation. They have slowed and recalibrated the pace and sequencing of capital account liberalisation. They have built up large foreign exchange reserves to act as a cushion against the adverse impact of external shocks to their balance of payments. In other words, they use their foreign exchange reserves to modulate large fluctuations in the exchange rate, or to meet the demand for foreign exchange emanating from a sudden shock to current account or reversal of capital flows. 10. In addition, they have strengthened their domestic macroeconomic policy frameworks by implementing credible fiscal rules, and have adopted a rule-based framework for monetary policy with inflation targeting or other close alternatives. They have strengthened their banking and financial sectors. Alongside, they have significantly enhanced the independence of their central banks. 11. As a result of these policy efforts, the world for the most part has not witnessed any country-specific or even regional Balance of Payments crises (barring a handful of exceptions) during the last two and a half decades. 10 This resilience has been markedly visible during the last five years when, EMs had to face multiple shocks in succession, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021), Russia-Ukraine war (2022) and other geopolitical tensions, surge in inflation resulting in synchronised monetary tightening by Advanced Economy central banks (2022-2023), and the ongoing trade policy and tariff shocks (2025). The fact that EMs, by and large, are able to tide over these shocks with relative macroeconomic stability is a testament to the success of aforementioned policy efforts. 12. This is not to say that the EMs do not face policy challenges anymore. They do. But instead of macroeconomic stability issues, EMs face greater risks to sustained growth, and meaningful employment generation. 13. Their key challenge lies in finding the new sources of growth. In learning to live in a world in which trade as an engine of growth is faltering, and, therefore, domestic sources of growth need to play a larger role. 14. The acceleration in economic growth witnessed across EMs in 2000s was driven by a rapid expansion in global trade. The ratio of world trade to GDP increased from about 41 per cent in 1994 to 61 per cent in 2008. 11 Since the global financial crisis of 2008-09, however, the global trade to GDP ratio has flattened, reducing the avenues for EMs to grow faster by leveraging global demand. 15. More recently, a new threat to global trade has emerged from the increased incidence of protectionism. Apart from reducing the contribution of external demand to growth, these developments also reduce the impact of potential spillover benefits to domestic growth through channels such as technology transfer. Even as some of the trade relations will be rebuilt and others will evolve during the course of time, the years of hyper globalisation are unlikely to return anytime soon. 16. Neither is the manufacturing sector turning out to be a sure way to economic success (the potential of the manufacturing sector seems to have become limited due to the existing large players continuing to be market leaders). 17. Another challenge, especially for those economies where demography is still favourable, is that under employment remains high, gender gaps remain wide, and a large share of workers remain in less productive informal jobs. 18. For some of the EMs, high public debt is also of concern. Many EMs undertook fiscal consolidation after they were hit by the crises in the 1990s. However, after the global financial crisis, public debt has risen steadily, exacerbated further by cascading shocks such as the fiscal stimulus during the pandemic, and higher interest burden of debt servicing from policy tightening. While there is no imminent risk to debt sustainability in EMs, elevated public debt poses a challenge in financing their developmental goals in the wake of rising interest payments to service this debt. Where does India stand on the resilience of its policy framework? 19. India's policy frameworks have continued to evolve and are currently among the global best. Its exchange rate, that was pegged until 1991, is increasingly market driven. Its external account has been managed well. There are inherent strengths in its diversified balance of payments. On the current account, the merchandise trade deficit has been balanced by strong services exports and remittances receipts. Oil price is not a dampener that it used to be. All in all, the current account shows resilience and is eminently in a sustainable zone. 12 20. The capital account too gets a variety of inflows, including FDI inflows that are traditionally known to be stable; and other equity and debt flows, which are traditionally known to be relatively fickle, but have held up well. India has slowly but surely liberalised its capital account, but the external debt as a proportion to GDP has been low and stable. The ratio of external debt to GDP has averaged around 20.5 per cent in the last 10 years (end-March 2015 to end-March 2025); as of end-June 2025, external debt to GDP ratio was 18.9 per cent. Besides keeping the liability dollarisation in check, India's short-term debt level too has remained low. The ratio of Short-term Debt (original maturity) to total debt was 18.1 per cent as of end-June 2025. 21. India has largely adhered to the path of fiscal consolidation, barring periods of significant shocks such as the pandemic. Importantly, the composition of debt, and the improved quality of public spending has rendered public debt safe. Most of the public debt is long term, is denominated in local currency, and is held domestically (a large part of which is held by institutional investors). Furthermore, a favourable growth and interest rate differential has made current level of public debt sustainable. 13 22. Flexible Inflation Targeting framework for monetary policy, introduced in 2016, was a major structural reform in India. Evidence points towards improved outcomes post adoption of flexible inflation targeting: inflation has become lower and less volatile; inflationary expectations are better anchored; and the transmission of monetary policy has become more effective. Inflation targeting has brought in greater transparency to policy making. Frequent communication has helped in anchoring expectations and in building credibility. There is continuous engagement with stakeholders, making monetary policy a two-way consultative process. 23. As a result of the full matrix of policy reforms, India's GDP and per capita income growth rates have accelerated over time; growth has been among the highest globally; and its variability has declined. 14 24. India's near-term growth outlook is promising too. After growing at a stronger than anticipated rate of 7.8 per cent during Q1:2025-26, various high frequency indicators point towards a robust expansion in Q2:2025-26 as well. In the latest monetary policy statement, growth forecast for FY2025-26 has been revised upwards to 6.8 per cent. Inflation currently is at an eight-year low of 1.5 per cent. As per the latest assessment of the RBI, CPI inflation is projected to be 2.6 per cent for the full year 2025-26, much below the target. Concluding thoughts 25. Having learnt from the crisis decade of the 1990s, EMs have put in place policy frameworks and decision-making processes that have made them less vulnerable to macroeconomic and financial instability. India has been a frontrunner in implementing these reforms. As a result, while the intensity of external shocks may not have declined, the variability of the macroeconomic outcomes has moderated considerably. This economic resilience has enabled the policy makers to focus on reforms to enhance productivity, facilitate ease of doing business, and improve the quality of financial intermediation. Such collective efforts are surely putting India on the path to graduate from an emerging to an emerged market status in the coming decades (and possibly even in the coming years). 1 Inputs received from Asish Thomas George, GV Nadhanael, and Somnath Sharma, and comments received from Indranil Bhattacharya, Anupam Prakash, Sunil Kumar, Sangita Misra and Satyashiba Panigrahi are gratefully acknowledged. 2 We are focusing here more on EMs, not on advanced economies or low-income economies which have their own unique economic features, potentials and challenges. 3 IMF and other multilateral agencies have also been pointing to the various risks that loom on the horizon. They refer to buoyant equity markets (particularly led by technology stocks) leading to worries that a correction could be in the offing. Central banks of advanced economies are concerned about elevated public debt in their respective economies and worry that there might be a disruptive resolution. The financial landscape has undergone significant change over the years, with non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) now playing a larger role in several markets, including the bond and credit markets. The growing size, complexity, and interconnectedness of these lightly regulated NBFIs in the financial system has raised financial stability concerns. 4 World Economic Outlook, October 2025. 5 Adaptability and entrepreneurship of the private sector and supportive financial conditions are the other factors. 6 Eichengreen, B. J., Hausmann, R., & Panizza, U. (2002). Original sin: the pain, the mystery, and the road to redemption. 7 I ended up writing two of the three papers in my PhD thesis on Twin Crises--when Balance of Payments and Banking Crises occur simultaneously and feed each other. 8 These have alternatively been called Currency Crises, Balance of Payments Crises or Sudden Stops. 9 Kaminsky, Graciela, L., and Carmen M. Reinhart.

CPI inflation declined from a peak of 6.7 per cent in 2022-23 to 4.6 per cent in 2024-25. As per the latest available data, CPI inflation was at 1.5 per cent in September 2025.",

Introduction The nomination facility is intended to facilitate expeditious settlement of claims by banks upon death of a deceased customer and to minimise hardship faced by the family members. The Government of India has notified the Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2025 which inter-alia has amended the Sections 45ZA, 45ZC and 45ZE of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (the Act). The Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 2025 have also been notified which along with amended provisions of the Act shall come into force from November 1, 2025. Accordingly, in order to align the regulatory instructions with the amended provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and corresponding Nomination Rules, it has been decided to review the extant instructions on the subject. II. Preliminary A. Preamble 2. These Directions are issued to provide regulatory instructions to banks to implement the nomination facility and shall be read with sections 45ZA to 45ZG of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (and with section 56 of the Act ibid when applied to cooperative banks) and the Nomination Rules framed thereunder. B. Powers Exercised 3. In exercise of the powers conferred by section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act,1949 (read with section 56 of the Act ibid when applied to cooperative banks), the Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter called the Reserve Bank), being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in public interest to do so, hereby issues the following Directions. C. Short Title 4. These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Nomination Facility in Deposit Accounts, Safe Deposit Lockers and Articles kept in Safe Custody with the Banks) Directions, 2025. D. Effective Date 5. These Directions shall come into force with effect from November 1, 2025. E. Applicability 6. These Directions shall apply to all banks. F. Definitions 7. In these Directions, unless the context otherwise requires, (a) ‘Act’ refers to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. (b) ‘Bank’ refers to a banking company, corresponding new bank, State Bank of India, Regional Rural Bank and Cooperative Bank, as defined in the Act. (c) ‘Rules’ refers to the Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 2025. III. Nomination Facility in Deposit Accounts, Safe Deposit Lockers and Articles kept in Safe Custody G. Nomination Facility 8.(1) A bank shall offer nomination facility in deposit accounts in accordance with the provisions of sections 45ZA, 45ZB and 45ZG of the Act (read with section 56 of the Act when applied to cooperative banks) and the Rules. (2) A bank shall be guided by the provisions of sections 45ZC to 45ZG of the Act (read with section 56 of the Act when applied to cooperative banks) and the Rules in the matter of nomination in safe deposit lockers and articles kept in safe custody. Explanation: For the purpose of these Directions, it is clarified that if an individual is keeping an account for his/ her proprietorship business, it will be deemed as that individual’s account and the nomination facility shall be offered in such accounts. H. Option to the customers not to make a nomination 9.(1) At the time of account opening, a bank shall explicitly inform the prospective customer of the availability and purpose of the nomination facility and offer him/her the option to avail the same. The bank shall also clearly explain to the prospective customer the advantages of the nomination facility, including but not limited to simplification of the claim process in the event of the account holder’s demise and facilitation of smooth and prompt transfer of funds to the nominee without legal complications. (2) If the prospective customer chooses not to avail the nomination facility despite being fully informed, the bank shall proceed to open the deposit account without imposing any restrictions, if otherwise found eligible, after obtaining a written declaration from the individual confirming that he/ she does not require the nomination facility at the time of account opening. If he/she refuses to provide the written declaration, the bank shall record the fact of refusal to submit written confirmation in the account opening records. (3) Under no circumstances shall a prospective customer be denied or delayed in opening an account solely on the ground of refusal to make a nomination, provided all other requirements for account opening are satisfactorily met. I. Incidental Matters 10. In case of simultaneous nomination, if any nominee dies prior to receiving the deposit from the bank, the nomination in respect of such nominee alone shall become ineffective. Accordingly, a bank shall settle the claims of the amount of deposit made in favour of such nominee in accordance with provisions applicable for accounts without nominee clause as contained in Reserve Bank of India (Settlement of Claims in respect of Deceased Customers of Banks) Directions, 2025 as amended from time to time. 11. A bank cannot claim a valid discharge under the provisions of the Act if payments are made to individuals based on nomination made under any other law for specified purposes. 12. A bank shall have in place appropriate systems and procedures to register in its books the registration, cancellation and variation of the nomination, as per the request of the customers. 13.(1) A bank shall devise proper systems for acknowledging the receipt of the duly completed forms of registration, cancellation and/ or variation of the nomination. (2) A bank shall verify and ensure that the nomination(s) made by its customers are in accordance with relevant provisions of the Act and the Rules before providing acknowledgement to them. (3) Such acknowledgement shall be given to the customers within three working days of receiving the forms of registration, cancellation and/ or variation of nomination, irrespective of whether the same is asked for by the customers. (4) Where a nomination request is found not to be in conformity with the provisions of the Act or the Rules and is consequently rejected, the bank shall inform the customer in writing, clearly indicating the reasons for such rejection, within three working days of the receipt of the request form. J. Details of nomination and name of nominee in Passbook/ Statement of Account and Term Deposit Receipt (TDR) 14.(1) A bank shall record the status regarding registration of nomination on the face of the passbook/ Statement of Account and TDR, with the legend \"Nomination Registered\". (2) A bank shall also indicate the name of the Nominee(s) in the Passbook/ Statement of Accounts and TDR in such cases. K. Customer guidance and publicity of benefits of nomination 15.(1) A bank shall give wide publicity and provide guidance to deposit account holders, locker hirers and depositors of articles in safe custody on the benefits of the nomination facility. This may include printing compatible messages on cheque book, passbook and other literature reaching the customers as well as launching periodical awareness drives. (2) A bank shall ensure that the form for opening deposit accounts, hiring safe deposit lockers and depositing articles in safe custody contains space for getting the details of nomination, which also serves the purpose of educating the customers about availability of such facility. IV. Miscellaneous L. Repeal Provisions 16.(1) With the issuance of these Directions, the instructions contained in the circulars mentioned in Annex , issued by the Reserve Bank, shall stand repealed from the effective date of these Directions. (2) Notwithstanding the repeal provisions, anything done or any action taken under the repealed instructions shall be deemed as valid, so long as they were done or taken in conformity with those instructions.

      "summary": "1. It is a pleasure to welcome all of you to this High-Level Dialogue on Forging Economic Resilience through Digital Public Platforms (DPPs). 2. Thank you for accepting our invitation to be a part of this dialogue. As key decision makers of your esteemed institutions, entrusted with safeguarding the economic heath and resilience of your respective economies, your presence amidst us today adds great value to this occasion. 3. I expect an enriching and fruitful discussion on today’s topic. It is of critical importance, as it has the potential to significantly enhance the economic well-being of our people. 4. India is an excellent example of how digital public platforms (DPPs) can impart tangible economic benefits and materially improve the lives of our citizens. I. Digital Public Platforms 5. During India's G20 Presidency, Digital Public Platforms were formally defined as a set of shared digital systems built upon minimal, modular digital building blocks that can be utilized by governments, businesses, academia, and civil society to facilitate society-wide development. 1 6. These platforms comprise open, secure, and interoperable systems that enable access to public and private services. Digital Identity, Payments, and Data Exchange form its foundational building blocks. 7. The G20 also established a comprehensive framework of guiding principles which underpin development and implementation of such platforms including, inclusivity to ensure universal access, interoperability for seamless system integration, scalability for large-scale deployment, security and privacy protection. II. Why Digital Public Platforms matter for central bankers – Economic Resilience as the driving force 8. Digital Public Platforms are of immense importance for Central Banks. 9. Central Banks not only serve as the ultimate guardians of economic resilience. They in many countries, are also responsible for enhancing financial inclusion and for operating and regulating critical payment and settlement infrastructure that form the backbone of modern economies. 10. Digital Public Platforms are an effective tool for achieving these objectives. They collectively lower barriers to inclusion and facilitate access to financial services. As a result, globally, around 865 million individuals opened their first account with financial institutions enabling quicker and hassle-free receipt of governmental grants and subvention 2 . 11. Development of fast payments systems (FPS) aligns with key public policy objectives, including creation of safe and efficient payment systems for everyone, reducing cash dependence, and supporting digitalisation. FPS continue to grow in both number and usage, having been established in more than 70 jurisdictions across the world. III. India as a case study in inclusive, secure, and scalable DPPs 12. India's Digital Public Platforms constitute a well-structured, multi-layered system of interconnected digital building blocks including digital identity through Aadhaar, instant payment systems via the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and secure data sharing through the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA). 13. For us, the guiding principle has been to build such platforms in the public sector as a public good with suitable guardrails, and without a profit motive. Public and private sector entities can then leverage on these platforms to quickly develop applications across credit, health, social protection, agriculture, and several other domains. 14. While the public sector establishes the foundational infrastructure layer, the success of Digital Public Platforms is bolstered by active private sector participation. Private sector engagement drives innovation and enhances competition, thereby elevating service quality and user experience. 15. Further, the private sector plays a vital role in innovating and nurturing vibrant developer communities and expanding digital markets. All of these contribute to the maturity of the ecosystem around the DPPs while maintaining the core principles of accessibility, inclusivity, and public benefit. 16. This approach has resulted in significant positive externalities for growth and development of digital payment systems in India. I will highlight a few initiatives taken by India to build such platforms. 17. I will start with Aadhaar, the unique identity platform. It is the very basic fundamental block for any digitalisation effort in a country. Aadhaar today has over 1.3 billion users. Using this identify platform, over 566 million bank accounts have been opened, 316 million of these belong to women. This has provided a significant fillip to financial inclusion initiatives. 18. It has also enabled direct benefit transfers (DBT) bypassing cash-based subsidy distribution and crediting subsidies directly into bank accounts. Over 500 billion USD have been transferred directly to beneficiaries, significantly reducing fraud and leakage. 19. Coming to payments, the Unified Payments Interface or UPI is another critical Digital Public Platform. It has transformed the payments landscape. It enables transfer of payments in real time, efficiently from one account to another across banks. 20. Around 85% of the digital payment transactions in India today are carried out through UPI. About 20 billion transactions are made using UPI every month, representing value equivalent to over 280 billion USD. 21. UPI is a powerful catalyst, accelerating financial inclusion. Small vendors and micro enterprises can now accept payments digitally, and build financial history, thereby enabling access to formal credit at much lower costs. 22. There are other benefits too. A recent research study on the impact of UPI suggests that higher UPI adoption is associated with lower cash demand 3 . Another study shows that a one percent increase in UPI transaction volumes correlates with a 0.03 percent increase in GDP growth 4 . 23. Digital payment systems have decreased delivery costs, minimised revenue leakages, and facilitated rapid deployment of emergency relief programmes, particularly during the global COVID-19 pandemic. IV. International Cooperation 24. We believe that the benefits of DPPs should be available to the whole world, in the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, which means, ‘the world is one family’. This was also the theme of India’s G20 presidency. We are fully committed to international collaboration around such platforms. 25. In the spirit of this collaboration, India developed the Modular Open-Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) 5 for digital identity. This free, secure, and scalable platform allows other countries to build their own national digital ID systems. 27 countries are currently either adopting or considering MOSIP-based systems, to deliver essential services quickly, directly, and seamlessly to their citizens. 26. For collaboration in digital payments, we have adopted three strategic approaches: (i) One, we are linking UPI with fast payment systems of other countries for cross-border remittances. Linkage between India and Singapore (UPI-PayNow) is live. Work is under progress with a few other countries bilaterally as well as multilaterally. (ii) Two, we are enabling cross-border merchant (P2M) payments through UPI via QR codes at merchant locations in both offline and e-commerce mode. This is already live in a few countries and work is in progress for enabling merchant payments in a few more countries. (iii) Three, we are supporting deployment of UPI-like sovereign payment rails or upgrading existing systems in partner countries using UPI technology stack, while agreement/MoU have been signed for deployment in a few more countries. 27. These efforts will also promote cross-border trade and payments, while encouraging efficiency, improving customer experience, and reducing cost. Concluding remarks 28. To conclude, Digital Public Platforms have proved to be central to inclusive growth in India. Their impact on welfare transfers, democratisation of payments and deepening of financial inclusion has, indeed, been transformative. We are committed to share our model to help countries accelerate digital transformation. I am confident that we can work together to empower our citizens through Digital Public Platforms.

      "summary": "Shri C S Setty, Chairman, State Bank of India, Mr Peter Simon, CEO and distinguished delegates of the WSBI, Shri Vinay Tonse, Managing Director, SBI and WSBI Asia Regional President, Friends, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, everyone! 2. At the outset, congratulations to WSBI for completion of a century, in bringing together savings and retail banks, from over 70 countries, representing the interests of customers of approximately 6,400 banks across all continents. As a global organisation, WSBI promotes a sustainable, inclusive and balanced growth and job creation around the world, with a clear focus on individual consumers, households and MSMEs. The members are main street players that are rooted strongly within the communities they serve, and support the local economies, with the shared values of being Retail, Regional and Responsible. I fondly recall my own association with WSBI during my time in SBI and I am thankful to SBI and WSBI for this kind invitation. 3. It is indeed a pleasure to welcome the WSBI delegation to India. During this study visit, I hope you will see how financial inclusion and digital innovation have evolved here through the interplay of public policy, regulatory oversight, and institutional initiatives. Along with recognising the challenges in India’s journey, I trust this visit will also provide space to reflect on how different approaches to inclusion and innovation can inform and enrich one another. 4. The idea I wish to underline today is that inclusion is innovation’s highest purpose . In India, financial inclusion has been pursued not as a single policy objective but as an ongoing national mission. Over the past decade, the Government, the Reserve Bank, and the banking sector have worked together to expand access to millions of households. The real task, however, lies in deepening usage, improving quality, and building lasting trust. 5. To capture progress along this journey, the Reserve Bank has developed a Financial Inclusion Index that tracks three dimensions—access, usage, and quality. 1 Over the years, there has been considerable progress made under the index. Five iterations of FI Index have been published till date, with March 2025 value standing perceptibly improved at 67.0 vis-à-vis 43.4 for the period ending March 2017. 2 Having said that, it is also an observation that, while access to financial services has improved significantly in recent years, the challenge now lies in promoting active usage and strengthening service quality. 6. Achieving this requires more than technology; it calls for products tailored to diverse needs and limitations, supported by human interfaces that build trust and confidence. ‘ Embedding empathy into service delivery ’ is a crucial step in ensuring that financial inclusion is meaningful and effective. 7. Equally important are transparent grievance redressal systems and clear consumer protection measures. Defined turnaround times, limited liability protections, and visible compensation frameworks reassure customers that they are safe in using digital services. Together, these measures foster confidence and encourage meaningful engagement with the financial system. Digital Public Infrastructure and India Stack 8. India’s strong digital public infrastructure underpins its financial inclusion efforts. At the centre of this architecture lies the India Stack —a set of interoperable, open, and scalable digital layers built as public goods. These include Aadhaar for digital identity, DigiLocker for secure digital storage and sharing of documents, and the Account Aggregator framework for consent-based data sharing. Together, they provide the rails on which a wide range of services can be delivered securely, at scale, and at an affordable cost. 9. Among these layers, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has emerged as the flagship success story. By integrating multiple accounts into a single mobile platform, UPI has revolutionised retail payments. 10. While UPI has rightly captured global attention, it represents only the most visible part of a much wider transformation. Behind it stands a comprehensive digital payments ecosystem that includes NEFT and RTGS for retail and high-value transfers, the Bharat Bill Payment System for interoperable bill payments, the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System for last-mile inclusion through micro-ATMs, and BharatQR for merchant acceptance. Together, these systems form a layered, resilient, and inclusive architecture. They ensure that digital transactions are not only fast and convenient but also secure, accessible, and trusted—cornerstones of India’s transition from a predominantly cash economy to a thriving digital one. 11. Building on this success, India is now developing the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), which seeks to bring the same principles of openness and interoperability to credit markets. Just as UPI made payments universal, ULI has the potential to mark a turning point in how affordable credit is accessed and delivered at scale. 12. Digital innovation is also extending inclusion beyond payments. Micro-insurance and pension products are increasingly being delivered through digital platforms, helping low-income households strengthen financial resilience. Cross-border UPI linkages are making remittances faster, cheaper, and more seamless, reinforcing trust in formal channels. RBI’s Role in Responsible Innovation 13. At the Reserve Bank, we seek to foster an environment where innovation can flourish responsibly. Through initiatives such as regulatory sandboxes, the Innovation Hub, and enabling frameworks for digital financial services, we encourage the development of new solutions that are secure, sustainable, and customer-centric. At the same time, we place due emphasis on governance, risk management, and customer protection, so that technological progress is always matched by resilience and trust in the financial system. 14. The rapid rise of fintechs, digital platforms, and embedded finance models has expanded the boundaries of the financial system and created new types of risks. These are not simply traditional risks in digital form, but new frontiers arising from algorithmic decision-making, heavy dependence on data, concentration of services in a few platforms, and deep technological interconnections. Left unmanaged, such risks can quickly migrate from individual institutions to the broader system. 15. This is why we encourage financial institutions to move to a proactive resilience mindset, embedding digital risk awareness and safeguards into their governance frameworks. Innovation and safety are not opposing goals; when balanced well, they reinforce each other and build lasting trust. Closing Reflections 16. As we look ahead, there is growing recognition worldwide that digital innovation is the most powerful driver of financial inclusion. India’s journey shows that access is only the first step—the true test lies in meaningful usage, in the quality of services, and in the trust that people place in the system. Innovations that do not embed responsibility can erode this trust, but when innovation and inclusion move together, they reinforce each other and create lasting transformation. 17. Allow me to return to the thought with which I began: inclusion is innovation’s highest purpose . As you reflect on India’s experience during this study visit, I hope you will see how collaboration between policy, regulation, and institutions can continue to widen the frontiers of inclusion. India’s journey shows that when innovation meets inclusion, transformation becomes inevitable . I hope this exchange inspires fresh ideas, new partnerships, and renewed resolve to make finance truly universal. Thank you. 1 The FI-Index has been conceptualised as a comprehensive index incorporating details of banking, investments, insurance, postal as well as the pension sector in consultation with Government and respective sectoral regulators. The index captures information on various aspects of financial inclusion in a single value ranging between 0 and 100, where 0 represents complete financial exclusion and 100 indicates full financial inclusion. The FI-Index comprises of three broad parameters (weights indicated in brackets) viz., Access (35%), Usage (45%), and Quality (20%) with each of these consisting of various dimensions, which are computed based on a number of indicators. It has been constructed without any ‘base year’ and as such it reflects cumulative efforts of all stakeholders over the years towards financial inclusion. 2 Reserve Bank of India introduces the Financial Inclusion Index",

      "summary": "I am very happy to participate in this 6th edition of the Global FinTech Fest (GFF). It is a premier forum where the wizards of technology intersect with the experts of finance. It is a unique forum where young innovators, brimming with bold ideas, converge with the steady wisdom of experienced leaders. This synergy which shapes solutions to common challenges reflects the true spirit of the GFF. This event also reflects India’s ambition to remain at the cutting edge of digital innovation. Over the years, the GFF has gained from strength to strength. I congratulate the organisers for this huge achievement. 2. In my remarks today, I wish to reflect on our Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and FinTech journey so far, the next phase of deepening and widening inclusion and sustainability, and the way ahead for FinTechs to translate these opportunities into tangible outcomes. DPI as the Engine for India’s Growth Story 3. DPI underpins India’s digital transformation over the last decade or so. It rests on three layers, that have played critical roles in addressing barriers to inclusion and enabling innovation at scale. 4. One, the identity layer, anchored by Aadhaar with more than 1.4 billion enrolments, has made it possible to authenticate identity instantly. It has also enabled millions to open bank accounts and participate in the formal financial system through electronic KYC. It is at the core of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for government benefits. 5. Two, the payments layer which translates identity into action. Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) has enabled banking through micro-ATMs and facilitated access even in remote locations. Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has allowed close to 490 million unique users to make nearly 20 billion transactions every month, almost half of the global real-time payment volumes. 6. Three, the data layer has reshaped how financial services are delivered. Take any government department, for instance. There is a tremendous amount of digitalisation that has happened in each department. I was in the Revenue Department earlier. With almost all income data now digitised, filing an income tax return in India takes only a few minutes. On average, returns are processed in 10 days and many taxpayers receive their refunds within 24 hours. We are among the world leaders in tax filing and processing systems. 7. Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is a unique model with no parallel in the world. 28 states, 8 UTs and the centre – all with a different GST statute passed by different legislatures, but still the same except the name of the state. This unification of GST has been possible because of the backbone provided by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN). All this has created a lot of digital data comprising the data layer . Further, DigiLocker with over 590 million users, has enabled citizens to store and share documents securely in a digital form. FinTech complementing the DPI 8. Complimenting these three layers of DPI, we have a vibrant FinTech ecosystem. The foundation of DPI allows FinTechs to set up quickly, scale rapidly, and deliver targeted solutions to not only address current but also future challenges. India is today home to over 10,000 FinTech companies, with cumulative investments exceeding USD 40 billion over the past decade. 9. The sector’s phenomenal growth and future potential is underpinned by several key strengths, apart from the robust DPI. These include a large and deep pool of skilled technology talent, a vibrant financial ecosystem spanning payments, lending, insurance, pensions, wealth management, etc. which is supporting FinTech innovation, and enabling policies and regulatory frameworks which are facilitating FinTechs. 10. Regular engagement with the FinTech ecosystem is central to this approach. RBI has been proactive in engaging with the FinTech sector, as is borne out by nearly 500 interactions with FinTech entities during FY 2024-25 alone. In addition, through structured platforms such as FinTeract and Finquiry, we interact regularly with innovators and entrepreneurs in the FinTech ecosystem. Since March 2024, we have conducted 15 structured sessions under Finteract , covering over 1,100 FinTech representatives. In addition, 14 open interactions with more than 600 participants have been held under Finquiry since June 2024. 11. The Reserve Bank has also established a FinTech Repository to collect key information on activities, products, and technologies, enabling more informed and evidence-based policymaking for the FinTech sector. 12. Recognising the diversity in the FinTech Sector, we have, so far, granted recognition to a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) in the FinTech Sector. This will enable FinTechs which are not directly regulated to operate within a calibrated framework with baseline governance standards and best practices developed by the industry itself. 13. Over the past decade, India has shown how technology, thoughtfully designed and implemented at scale, can be a force multiplier for sustainable economic development. The FinTech industry, has made it possible to deliver financial services at population scale, at an affordable cost. We will continue the facilitation for FinTechs to make use of the DPI and financial ecosystem for the collective benefit of the economy. This synergy between public rails and private innovation, has been the bedrock of India’s success in several domains, including digitalisation of payments. The Next Phase of India’s Digital Journey 14. The first phase of India’s digital journey was about building the foundation and expanding access to financial services such as savings, insurance, investments. The next phase is about universalising and deepening impact by using data responsibly. I will talk about five areas. Some work has been done in all these areas but more needs to be done. These are: (a) aggregation and leveraging financial data; (b) the digital rupee; (c) asset tokenisation; (d) artificial intelligence; and (e) digital frauds. Aggregation and Leveraging Financial Data Ac count Aggregator (AA) 15. First, we need to develop DPI for data integration across various data sources to widen and deepen financial inclusion. The Account Aggregator (AA) framework is one such endeavour. It is empowering individuals to share their financial data safely with regulated entities. This ecosystem has seen notable progress with 17 AAs, 650 Financial Information Users (FIUs), 150 Financial Information Providers (FIPs), 160 million accounts being served, and 3.66 billion data requests from FIUs processed by AAs. Many important government owned data sources like the GSTN have been included in the AA framework. 16. On its part, the RBI is in the process of introducing standards designed to improve customer onboarding processes, enhance user interfaces, strengthen data security, and increase transparency in consent management and data sharing under the AA framework. 17. While there is huge potential for the AA framework to grow, its success will depend on two critical aspects, namely, integration with more financial information, especially information which is vital for assessing the financial status of an individual, and interoperability across account aggregators. ULI 18. The Unified Lending Interface (ULI) is another landmark step in data aggregation. Credit remains the lifeblood of inclusive growth. Despite best efforts by the Government, RBI, and the banking system, and huge progress made in this regard, a vast credit gap still persists. The ULI seeks to bridge the gap by enabling efficient, data-driven, and inclusive credit delivery. 19. Since its launch in August 2023 till October 03, 2025, the ULI pilot has now expanded to 120 data sources/services, 58 lenders including banks, NBFCs, co-operative banks with 3.2 million loans sanctioned and ₹1.75 trillion in lending. The ULI is also enabling use of data by lenders to build alternative credit models, thereby helping expand credit to new-to-credit segments lacking credit history. Digital Rupee (e₹) 20. Second, India’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Digital Rupee (e₹) represents a critical new rail in the DPI architecture. Since its launch in December 2022, the retail e₹ pilot today has 19 banks and 7 million users, enabling person-to-person (P2P) as well as person-to-merchant (P2M) transactions. Interoperability with UPI is also enabling wider adoption of the e₹ without compromising user convenience. 21. Programmability features in e₹ are unlocking new paradigms in purpose-driven direct benefit transfers, subsidies, and targeted lending. These features have been leveraged by some state governments demonstrating the potential for making subsidy delivery and DBT more effective. For instance, Gujarat’s G-SAFAL scheme uses programmable CBDC (p-CBDC) to provide livelihood assistance, allowing beneficiaries to spend subsidies only on whitelisted agri-inputs within a geofenced area. Similarly, Andhra Pradesh’s DEEPAM 2.0 scheme provides LPG subsidies through p-CBDC, which is redeemed on delivery of gas cylinders by the registered gas agencies. Asset Tokenisation 22. Third, asset tokenisation offers new possibilities for Indian financial markets in expanding access, improving transparency, and enhancing settlement efficiency through smart contracts. 23. I am happy to announce that the Reserve Bank has conceptualised the Unified Markets Interface (UMI), as a next-generation financial market infrastructure. UMI will have the capability to tokenise financial assets and settlements using wholesale CBDC. Early results from the inaugural pilot on the issuance of Certificate of Deposit, in improving market efficiency are encouraging. Artificial Intelligence 24. Fourth, AI holds the potential to fundamentally enhance the next generation of DPI in two complementary ways. First, by integrating AI into existing DPI layers, user experience and efficiency can be significantly improved. For example, conversational payments can simplify transactions for users with low digital literacy and bring millions into the formal economy. Second, AI itself can be developed as a public goods infrastructure. 25. The report of the FREE-AI committee constituted by RBI has also highlighted the importance of building foundational public goods for AI in finance, including a standardised financial sector data infrastructure, compute resources, and the development of indigenous AI models, tailored to the needs of the financial system. Digital Frauds 26. Fifth, the rapid expansion of digital finance has also created new challenges such as digital frauds and cyber threats. The Reserve Bank has instituted several customer protection measures, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), tokenisation of card on file, and providing customers with the control to switch off transactions to secure digital transactions. 27. The recently announced principle-based framework on authentication of digital transactions will provide further impetus to enhancing consumer convenience while strengthening trust in digital transactions. Exclusive internet domains, ‘. bank.in’ and ‘. fin.in’, for banks and financial institutions, and designated numbering series, i.e., ‘1600xx’ for transactional and service calls, and ‘140xx’ for promotional communications by regulated entities, are other initiatives to enhance security and public trust in digital transactions. 28. MuleHunter.ai, developed by the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub has been scaled up from about 5 banks at the beginning of this year to 21 banks. Unlike earlier approaches, this is enabling them to use system-wide learning to improve detection of mule accounts. Work is also underway on the Digital Payments Intelligence Platform (DPIP), which will leverage latest technologies to provide shared intelligence for fraud detection and prevention in near-real time. 29. These measures will enhance customer safety and trust in digital payments. We all need to redouble our efforts to keep our systems safe, secure and fraud proof. Conclusion 30. We stand at an important juncture in our digital finance journey. The past decade has demonstrated how technology can expand access and empower businesses. The next phase must build on this strong foundation, while keeping trust and stability at its central theme. The role of FinTechs in this next phase will be even more crucial. FinTechs can be the architects who design and construct digital highways and also the products and services on this digital highway that generate social and economic value. 31. I would like to leave five thoughts for the FinTech industry to consider. One, build for Inclusion: while there may be higher profits to be made by deepening access to the haves and the privileged, prioritise building systems to expand financial services to the unaccessed, unreached and unserved segments of society. Two, adopt customer-first approach: As Steve Jobs said, “Get closer than ever to your customers. So close that you tell them what they need well before they realize it themselves”. Design products and services that are easy to use and accessible for all, with assistive technologies ensuring vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, individuals with limited digital literacy, and the specially abled are not left behind. As I have said at other fora, strive to design services so well that there is no need for customer service in the first place. Three, innovate in credit delivery: Extend the success of digital payments to credit delivery, especially to small businesses and individuals. Four, prioritise trust and compliance: Embed strong data protection, transparency, and safeguards for consumers into every product and service. Five, think global, anchor local: Engage with international partners, share learnings, adopt global best practices, and strengthen India’s role in shaping the future of digital finance. 32. By embracing these principles and building on India’s unique strengths of DPI, a vibrant ecosystem, a digitally connected population, enabling policies, and tech talent, FinTechs can bridge digital divides, foster healthy competition, and drive innovation. 33. In doing so, FinTechs will not only secure their own growth but also play a pivotal role in driving progress and contributing to the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. 34. In this hall, we have people with both the foresight and the capability to act. Let us harness this opportunity and together shape a shared future of inclusive, sustainable, and innovation-driven growth. Thank you. Jai Hind.",

      "summary": "Good afternoon, distinguished policymakers, members of academia, industry leaders and innovators. It is both a pleasure and a responsibility to address this gathering on a subject that is poised to shape the future of finance, society, and governance alike—Responsible Artificial Intelligence. AI has rapidly evolved from an academic discussion less than a decade back to become an integral part of our daily lives. We encounter it when we unlock our phones, interact with chatbots, and increasingly, when accessing financial services. In just a few years, AI has evolved from an enabling technology to a foundational driver of how individuals and businesses make decisions. Globally, AI is already reshaping financial systems. From digital credit underwriting to conversational banking assistants, AI is demonstrating its ability in ways unimaginable a decade ago. India, too, has been a notable participant in this journey. Yet, as with all powerful innovations, AI carries a dual narrative. It promises extraordinary efficiency, inclusion, and innovation, but if left unattended, could pose unprecedented threats. As Stephen Hawking said in 2016 at the launch of the Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI), “the rise of powerful AI will either be the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity. We do not yet know which.” It is acknowledged widely that AI could be the permanent answer to poverty and disease. But equally there have been concerns from AI experts – ranging from concern around bad actors using AI for bad things to the more fundamental concern that human existence is irrelevant once machines achieve superintelligence. I do not intend to dwell on these widely divergent possibilities but only to highlight the limited point that while the benefits of AI are transformative, they need to be used responsibly. In finance, the margin for error is even narrower as financial institutions are built on trust and economies prosper on stability. Therefore, the integration of AI in financial systems must be approached as a matter of profound responsibility with due recognition and mitigation of risks. AI for the Financial Sector The Benefits The promise of Artificial Intelligence in finance is by now well recognised. At its core, AI can expand financial access, strengthen safeguards, and reimagine efficiency. It can lead to better credit assessment through use of alternative data (like transaction patterns, utility payments, etc.) of unbanked customers. Ability to use massive data sources could help in real-time detection of frauds through identification of unusual transaction patterns, or improve market risk modeling. Operational efficiency and cost reduction can get a paradigm shift using AI, e.g., in back-office processes, KYC, loan processing etc. Chatbots and virtual assistants would achieve 24x7 customer support. Data extraction from financial documents (e.g., invoices, contracts) through Natural Language Processing (NLP) could make document processing seamless. In the investment and trading space, the ability of AI models to detect short-term price inefficiencies are already being harnessed. Other benefits include allocation optimisation, use of big data to forecast market movements etc. AI driven RegTech applications help regulated entities with better compliance outcomes. Automated monitoring helps detection of suspicious transactions and generates faster compliance. AI has the potential to significantly expedite financial inclusion through alternative credit scoring models while language interfaces will remove language barriers and reach digitally limited customers. Investment advice becomes affordable to small investors through robo-advisors. The Risks But these benefits come with significant risks. AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data. It is natural that the learning from the data would also extend to learning the bias inherent in data. AI systems trained on biased historical data are likely to perpetuate or amplify historical discrimination in, for example, credit profiling, or hiring. Even small biases in training data can lead to systematic exclusion of population groups from accessing financial services. Algorithmic opacity would make it difficult to identify possible biases. The ‘Black Box’ problem of AI models, or, in other words, the lack of explainability, makes these models non-transparent. This makes it hard for regulators and auditors to understand how decisions are made, which, in turn, undermines accountability. Regulatory actions, or denial of service to customers, would typically require reasons to be communicated. Absence of explainability may thus constrain the use of such tools. There are systemic risks typical to AI systems, such as herding behaviour when AI-driven trading models get widely used, which can amplify volatility. AI misjudgments can trigger market dislocations. Such problems are amplified by the possibility that it becomes difficult to assign responsibility when an AI makes a harmful or erroneous decision. Legal frameworks would always find it difficult to catch up with fast moving technology. Over-reliance on automation could result in losing oversight or delayed intervention when things go wrong. There is also the ethical issue of using behavioral data for manipulative cross-selling or risk profiling. Then there is the ongoing debate about AI and job displacement. Whether AI will displace jobs in the long run would depend on whether it is like other transformative changes in history like the Industrial Revolution or the invention of electricity or whether it is a fundamentally different kind of change. Max Tegmark, founder of Future of Life Institute argues that while all past technologies amplified human ability but did not replace human intelligence, AI is the first technology that creates intelligence itself. Recognizing these risks is not to diminish the promise of AI, but to underline the importance of adopting it responsibly through safeguards, governance, and foresight. Balancing Innovation with Stability The key question is, how do we enable innovation while safeguarding systemic stability? This balance is a necessity for ensuring that AI strengthens rather than undermines the financial system. If regulatory frameworks are too rigid, they can dissuade experimentation, reducing AI to a tool deployed only by the largest players. On the other side, unbridled adoption, particularly in high-impact areas, could create vulnerabilities that are invisible until they snowball into crises. The balance is not only about restraint; it is also about actively encouraging innovation. This requires policies that create safe spaces for experimentation, such as sandboxes, facilitate open digital infrastructures, and provide access to quality data, enabling firms to innovate with confidence. It also requires incentives for responsible innovation, so that firms see governance not as a burden but as a competitive advantage. Responsible AI – Guiding Principles As we reflect on the transformative potential of AI, it becomes imperative to anchor its adoption within a framework of principles. The RBI took a proactive step through setting up the FREE-AI Committee, which has articulated a set of guiding sutras for responsible and ethical adoption of AI in the financial sector. These principles are intended to serve as touchstones for all stakeholders. At the core is the principle of trust, the bedrock of finance. Every deployment of AI must reinforce, not diminish, the trust of consumers, institutions, and society. Equally important is a people-first orientation, ensuring that technology serves human needs. The report emphasizes innovation over restraint, coupled with fairness and accountability in outcomes. AI can inform decisions, but it cannot own them. The accountability must always rest with human actors and institutions deploying AI. The principle of ‘understandable by design’ underscores the need for transparency, ensuring that AI decisions are explainable to both regulators and consumers. And above all, safety and resilience must be built into every layer of adoption. Alongside regulatory oversight, it is equally critical to encourage industry-led codes of conduct, self-regulation, and the institutionalisation of ethical standards. This collaborative approach ensures that responsibility is not a mandate of regulators but a shared culture across the fintech ecosystem. RBI’s Approach and Role The RBI has always fostered “innovation within safeguards.” Through calibrated guidance, supervisory oversight, and structured engagement with industry, the RBI aims to foster an ecosystem where financial innovation flourishes without compromising systemic stability. As AI reshapes the financial landscape, this approach remains unchanged - progress and prudence must go hand in hand. RBI has also taken initiatives for the industry through RBIH, such as MuleHunter.ai™ for combating the menace of mule accounts. Unlike the traditional rule-based systems currently used by banks, MuleHunter.ai™ offers greater accuracy and precision with significantly low false positive rates. Currently, the model has been deployed in about 20 commercial banks. In addition, work is also underway to explore a Digital Payments Intelligence Platform (DPIP), that can analyse and assign a risk score to transactions on a real time basis. Ringfencing and Guardrails While AI holds immense promise, the financial system demands the highest degree of prudence. Critical infrastructures and institutions must be ringfenced from unchecked risks that could arise from untested or poorly governed AI deployments. The objective is not to obstruct innovation but to ensure that its application never compromises the stability or integrity of the system. To this end, practices such as stress-testing of AI models under diverse scenarios, red-teaming to identify vulnerabilities, and the adoption of explainability tools and standards are indispensable. These mechanisms would help regulators and institutions alike to supervise AI outcomes, detect weaknesses before they escalate, and ensure that AI-driven decisioning can be understood and, if necessary, challenged. Equally important is that AI systems are subjected to rigorous oversight and layered with inherent checks. Financial AI applications must be designed such that they cannot inadvertently destabilize markets, payment systems, or consumer confidence. This approach demands “safety by design” rather “safety as an afterthought.” Safeguards must be embedded throughout the lifecycle, from conception and data training to model validation and real-world application. Retrofitting safety once risks have materialized is inadequate and potentially destabilizing. Research, Innovation, and Collaboration Embedding AI in finance is not a one-time exercise. It demands continuous research, experimentation, and learning, as models, techniques and risks evolve rapidly. It also calls for partnerships among industry, academia, regulators, and start-ups. Co-developing solutions, sharing knowledge, and stress-testing innovations must be fostered. Entities should have in place systems for responsible data governance, ethical sourcing of data, and privacy-by-design in every model. They should develop common standards, toolkits, and disclosure mechanisms so that model design, training data, and decision logic can be explained to regulators and customers. Safeguards such as digital watermarking of synthetic content should be explored to deter misuse. Internal policies and processes must be revised to embed AI risk assessment into the product lifecycle. Continuous monitoring, stress scenarios, and independent audits should be institutionalised. The Way Forward As we look ahead, the path for responsible AI in India’s financial sector is exciting yet deliberate, demanding a phased approach that balances innovation, inclusion and stability. Alongside technological progress, the human element remains central. AI literacy for consumers to understand both the potential and risks of AI will be critical. Just as financial literacy has been a national priority, the coming decade will require a parallel focus on AI literacy, for individuals to engage confidently and safely with these new tools. In the short term, the focus needs to be on awareness and capacity building. Financial institutions, technology providers, and regulators must train personnel, strengthen internal governance structures, and introduce initial risk frameworks to ensure that AI deployment is encouraged with focus on safety. Awareness campaigns and workshops can also help smaller institutions and FinTechs integrate AI responsibly. In the medium term, the FREE-AI principles should guide the industry practice. AI can begin to play a substantial role in SupTech, credit decisioning, and financial inclusion. In parallel, the industry should develop its own governance standards, self-regulatory codes, and ethical guidelines to complement regulatory oversight. In the long term, India can aspire to become a trusted global hub for responsible AI in finance. By demonstrating how innovation can coexist with strong safeguards, India can set an example for emerging economies and the Global South, attracting talent, investment, and collaboration. Concluding Remarks As we conclude, it is essential to reiterate that AI must remain a force for good - empowering individuals, strengthening institutions, and enhancing the resilience of our financial system. Its promise will be realised only when adopted responsibly, with constant attention to societal impact. Responsible AI should not be framed merely as a regulatory requirement, but as a matter of business ethics. Every model deployed, every decision automated, and every service enabled through AI must reinforce the confidence of consumers, provide fair access, and respect the dignity and privacy of all participants. Let me leave you with five guideposts. Not as tasks, but as a collective mission: the 5Ts Trust – Commit to building AI systems that uphold and enhance the trust in the system. Embed responsibility and ethics in every algorithm. Transparency – Reinforce clarity and explainability in AI, ensuring that decisions can be understood, audited, and questioned when necessary. Training – Invest in training to nurture a world-class AI talent within our financial ecosystem. Ensure India leads in creating, not just consuming. Technology for Good – Let innovation be guided by purpose. The test of every AI application must be whether it advances inclusion, resilience, and efficiency. Togetherness – Above all, we must work together. Regulators, industry, academia, and global partners, to collaborate and co-develop. Through shared commitment, ethical deployment, and continuous vigilance, we can ensure that AI fulfils its promise as a transformative enabler. 1 Keynote address delivered by Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar at the Global Fintech Festival, Mumbai on October 7th, 2025",

Rabi Sankar – Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Shri Swaminathan J – Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Dr. Poonam Gupta – Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya – Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India Dr. Ajit Joshi – Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India Moderator: Shri Puneet Pancholy – Chief General Manager, Reserve Bank of India Puneet Pancholy: Hello, and good afternoon. Welcome to this Post Policy Press Conference, fourth for the financial year 2025-26. Friends, we have with us Governor, Reserve Bank of India, Shri Sanjay Malhotra; Deputy Governors, Shri M. Rajeshwar Rao; Shri T. Rabi Sankar; Shri Swaminathan J; and Dr. Poonam Gupta. We also have with us Executive Directors, Dr. Ajit Joshi, and for the first time Shri Indranil Bhattacharyya. I also welcome my other colleagues from the Reserve Bank. As always, we will have a few housekeeping announcements. Sir, there are around 23 participants from the media. And I request the media participants to please stick to one question so that everybody gets a chance. I would also request everyone to switch on the mic when they are intervening, so that the people listening to this transmission, they are able to listen clearly. And once you are done, please switch it off. Sir, so with your permission, I will call out the names. I would ask Ms. Latha Venkatesh from CNBC TV-18, to ask the first question. Latha, please. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Thank you, Puneet. And thank you, Governor, for the opportunity. You have said in the statement that the fall in inflation opens up space for further supporting growth. You have omitted the word limited, which was there previously when you said limited space. So, should we understand there is space for more than one cut? And what is the trigger? If you had the space, why not now? What trigger are you waiting for? You also said that the transmission is broad based. Are you okay with the way bond yields have moved? There doesn't seem to be transmission there. Sanjay Malhotra: Yes, there is a change as you have noticed. I mean, inflation has reduced considerably since we met earlier in June by 1% and so that does open up the space. At the same time, growth you have seen while it has surprised us on the upside in Q1, Q3, Q4 and even next year, there is a downward revision slightly. And as mentioned, it is on account of the tariff, the 50% tariff that has come into play, offset to some extent by the GST. Why not a rate cut, is again, you know, given in our Statement, monetary policy transmission, while it has been good across sectors, it is still happening. And it is not only monetary policy transmission, there are other policies, for example, the Government’s GST rate and a number of other policies announced by the Hon’ble PM and the Government. They are taking shape, and their impact is still unfolding. At the same time, there are still a lot of uncertainties. We see developments every week, every day. And we also see responses there too. There is still clarity on that account. And so that is why the MPC felt that we should pause. Insofar as transmission to government bonds is concerned, you are aware that there was a good transmission of about from 6.86 peaks, or thereabout to 6.30, about 46 basis points. And after that there has been a hardening. So, the net impact thereof is only about 26, 6.59 today, so about 30 basis points. More than 30 basis points, yes, about 30 or less than 30 basis points in the government yields. We are watchful, and we will see, you know, how ultimately it is of course, you know, for the demand and supply. We will see how all the needs of the economy are supported. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Speak about limited. Why did you drop that word? Sanjay Malhotra: I mentioned, no, that inflation has dropped by 1% from our earlier forecast. It is now at 2.6% from our earlier forecast. So, it has dropped down by 1% and so that is why that's the reason. And the growth at the same time, I did mention, has also been revised slightly downwards primarily, of course, you know, as I mentioned, on account of trade-related, the higher tariff that has come into play, which is still negotiations going on, etc., still unfolding. But we have taken that. Latha Venkatesh, CNBC-TV18: Space to cut. Limited space? Sanjay Malhotra: We have made that change. And that's the reason. The changing growth inflation dynamics is the reason that we have changed the language. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. For the next question, I will ask Mr. Mayur Shetty from Times of India. Mayur, please. Mayur Shetty, Times of India: Sir, since the last policy there has been a lot of headwinds from the United States, there has been tariff notice, and the H1B Visa and the US Commerce Secretary has also been talking about the need to ‘fix India’. You have made some adjustments to the growth forecast and what exactly does it mean for the financial market? And just the GST reforms and deregulations you mentioned are they enough to offset the US impact? Sanjay Malhotra: That is the attempt that whatever are the external headwinds, we try to counter them. Ours is primarily a domestic demand-driven economy, so the impact is limited. It is not as high as some of the other countries, as I had earlier mentioned. And the government, as well as the RBI, both fiscal, monetary, and other policies, we will make all efforts to ensure that whatever are the headwinds, they can be countered. At the same time, you are aware that negotiations are still going on. Government is looking at other means, opening up other markets. There has already been a trade deal with the UK. Negotiations are on with so many other countries including Oman, EU, etc. that will also open up markets for our exporters. And on the whole, the growth, Indian growth has been quite resilient, and we are very hopeful that we will continue to maintain a very high growth trajectory while maintaining price stability. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, I will have Mr. Manojit Saha from Business Standard. Manojit, please. Manojit Saha, Business Standard: Thank you, Governor. The commentary is that inflation is coming down while there is softening of the bond yields because of the trade related uncertainties. I wanted to understand, so this clearly hints that going ahead rates can probably come down. Rates going up is not an option. So, is there a discussion to change the stance to accommodative? Sanjay Malhotra: Yes, there was a discussion as you have already noted. Two members wanted. You do not have a vote. It is more of a forward guidance. Let me again clarify. This was clarified in one of the earlier policies. It has got nothing to do with liquidity. It is only as a measure of forward guidance as to where the rates can be going forward. So, two members, Professor Ram Singh and Dr. Nagesh Kumar, wanted, (and) have given their guidance as accommodative, while the others have maintained it at neutral. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Ms. Hamsini from Moneycontrol. Hamsini, please. Hamsini Karthik, Moneycontrol: Thank you. Good afternoon, Governor. I will add a little from macro aspects. One of the things in the policy speech which sort of caught my attention a lot was the limits for specified large corporates. That has been sort of done away with and the reason in 2016 it was introduced, one of the reasons cited was to also develop a very vibrant bond market and derisk the banking sector to some extent. So, now that we have gone back on that, what is the inference that one should make that credit growth for large corporates should once again come back or be fed by banks? Or despite all efforts to create a little bit of vibrancy in bond markets, it is not yet picking up. How should we infer that particular change, sir? And as a continuation to that, a lot of changes have also come pro-banking sector in this particular speech. Like, for instance, funding acquisitions, etc. What was the rationale in making or in opening the doors for ease of doing business for banks, granting a lot of their wants? Sanjay Malhotra: A lot of questions in one question only. First of all, my understanding is that the 2016 Policy was more about mitigating risk and reducing, limiting exposure to large corporates at the banking system level, not at the bank level. For the bank level, I would like to clarify that the large exposure framework which was there continues. There is no change at the bank level, individual bank level, whatever is the large exposure framework continues. The banking system level, any borrower which was having an exposure, a credit limit of ₹10,000 crore or more from 2019 onwards, this limit was progressively reduced from 25 to 15 to 10,000 starting from 2016 to 2019. That has been done away because it is felt that the large exposure framework is able to take care of the needs at the individual bank level and at the banking system level, if there is a need, we have the macroprudential tools already to take care of that. Thirdly, you have been seeing that the share of corporates in total banking exposure has in fact come down over the years. I do not have the right numbers. I think last 10 years, it has reduced by about 10% or so. So, the risks are not so many. So, that is the primary reason why we have reduced, why we have proposed to remove this large exposure framework for specific borrowers at the banking system level. And then there are a number of other measures, ease of doing business. I think we announced seven measures on top of some five measures, smaller measures which we had announced a few days, couple of days ago. That is a continuous process. We need to continue looking at rationalising our regulations so that the productive needs of the economy are met with the least of compliance burden, with the least of cost, while at the same time, ensuring that wherever prudential measures are required, they are not compromised. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now, I would like to request Mr. Anurag Shah from ET Now Swadesh to ask his question. Mr. Anurag. Anurag Shah, ET Now Swadesh: Thank you Mr. Puneet. Sir, you talked about GST reform at the beginning of your statement and at the end as well. So, sir, the target of growth which has been revised, what is the contribution of tariff in that and what is the contribution of GST reform? Because this reform has started from the September 22. So, in the future, there can be more change in the outlook of growth. And the inflation which you have brought from 3.1% to 2.6%, the GST reform which was announced by the government and before that in the budget, which was announced in the personal income tax, after both of these, people will get a lot of money and it will go into consumption. So, how much impact will it have on inflation? I had asked a question last time, but I could not ask it correctly. So, if you allow me, can I ask it later? Sanjay Malhotra: So, first, what you have said, the impact of all this, whether it is GST, whether it is 50% tariff, in the baseline we have considered baseline tariff as 50% in all our estimates. So, but as it was said in the statement, as far as growth rate is concerned, the 50% tariff and along with that the uncertainty, the global demand, it has two impacts. One is the global demand, not only US demand, but on the whole global demand, there will be a reduction. There is an impact due to which, as you know, 20 basis points, before that we had 6.7% to 6.5% and now the impact of 50% is on direct exports in the US which can be reduced if the current talks that are going on yield constructive results and the impact of GST will be less than that. So, it will not be able to offset completely. In total, as we said, there is a reduction of 20 basis points and all these impacts, we have assumed this assumption. In total, however in this year because in the first 6 months, there has been good economic activity and the numbers have already come to us, so in total, the growth forecast for this year has increased. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. If you get time, ask later. Everyone else should get a chance. Thank you, sir. Next, I will request Ms. Swati Bhat from Reuters. Swati Bhat, Reuters: Thank you, sir. So, at the RBI for the last decade or so, largely the focus has been on reducing the banking sector risks, but now by easing the large exposure framework, allowing banks to fund acquisitions, IPO financing, more in shares, aren’t you in some way making, inviting possible risks here? I mean, and what are we trying to achieve through all this easing? Can you just throw some light on that? Thank you. Sanjay Malhotra: We have taken measures, very balanced, calibrated, thought out, considered, even though we will still be doing a public consultation, even pre the formal consultation, a number of consultations, and there are measures on both sides. There are at least a couple of them, ECL, credit risk related capital adequacy norms, which I would not say would put higher requirement, I do not think so, but it will be better targeted. Those banks, depending on the risks, some of them may have to provide and keep higher credit, it will be better targeted. And similarly, some of the other measures that we have taken to enhance the flow of credit, improve the competitiveness of the banks. It is not as if those measures were not there at all. For example, acquisition finance was already allowed for infrastructure companies and now we have expanded it. Similarly, the loans against shares, etc. or for IPO financing, it was already there. It was not revised for a number of years. It is but natural that we revise them. I think on the whole, all these measures taken together and we will continue to take more measures as and when required. Always the aim will be to promote the stability while at the same time, improving competitiveness, encouraging and enhancing growth of the economy. Do you want to come in? M. Rajeshwar Rao: Sir, I think as Governor has already mentioned. Sanjay Malhotra: Because number of measures actually, pertain to regulation division, I will request DG MRR to… M. Rajeshwar Rao: I think most of the measures have been well thought out and calibrated, one. Second, the banking system's ability to handle the risks has improved over the period. So, there is some enough provisions. Third, most of the measures have enough guardrails built into them to safeguard the interests of the banks and the financial system. And speaking of the loans against shares, I think while the limit has gone from ₹20 lakhs to ₹1 crore, I think the limits were last revised in 1998. So, inflation itself, if you factor it in, it is not really a very significant increase. So, overall, I think it has been a calibrated set of measures and again, it is coming up for public consultation. So, we will take the feedback and revise it, if appropriately required. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sirs. Next, we will have Mr. Vishwanath Nair from NDTV Profit. Vishwanath Nair, NDTV Profit: Good afternoon, Governor. I will go back to your first speech as RBI Governor where you spoke about the cost of regulation and the ease of regulation. Are we to see these 22 guidelines that or whatever indications of guidelines that you have listed out in today's speech as a move towards that? Because while ECL is a very necessary and very delayed sort of framework that is coming in, a lot of others seem to be giving banks whatever they were asking for, some of it. Like, for example, acquisition financing or something else, banks have been speaking very vocally about it in the last few weeks. Is that how we should see these moves? Sanjay Malhotra: Yes, see, circumstances change, times change, requirements change and so nothing should be frozen in time. And so, that is why we had earlier also said that we will be continuously reviewing our regulations. In fact, we have decided in the FSDC under the chairmanship of the Finance Minister where all the finance sector regulators come together to review each and every regulation every 5 to 7 years. So, while we are doing that and while it will be a continuous process as you are mentioning, some of these things which have come our way, we have thought it appropriate to revise them and it is very important that we continuously revise, review, improve our whole regulatory ecosystem. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Anup Roy from Bloomberg. Anup Roy, Bloomberg: Thank you, sir. Sir, in the policy you mentioned about rupee reference rate with trading partners, now with major trading partners, so far we have four-rupee reference rate and now it will be expanded. So, what are those currencies and also, I wonder what will be the benchmark reference rate that you will use and will that also increase rupee’s trading in the international market? Like, what I mean is that earlier there used to be a cross-currency like INR-USD and then say, USD-CNY. How will you fix that? T. Rabi Sankar: Yes, I think the objective is that you minimise the use of crossing currencies to get rates. Now, that will help both our currency as well as the other currency. We are currently looking at a couple of currencies. We are looking at Indonesian Rupiah as one, we are looking at AED (UAE Dirham) for another, but there are a few others. We will gradually keep taking them up. About your question on how do we set the benchmark, we will have to see. We will have to see because there are not many active transactions to begin with. So, FBIL has to work out - what is the best way of initiating something. This is a case where the pricing, the reference has to be shown first, and the market has to pick up from there. So, keeping that in mind, we will have to work out ways of how do we arrive at, what benchmarks do we use for these reference rates. Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Now I will invite Ms. Ekta Suri from Zee Business to ask her question. Ekta Suri, Zee Business: Good afternoon, sir. My question is related with common people and their pocket. I would like to ask that since the time of last policy to this policy, 2-3 news have made headlines. The first one is that according to banking sector, the way UPI transactions are increasing there is a burden on our infrastructure, but the cost is not yet being recovered. So, is it that in coming days will there be some fees on the UPI big transactions. And the second news is that the banking sector is saying that if the house is on mortgage in home loan with us or gold is mortgaged in gold loan then if we talk about the smart appliances like smart phones, then there is no possibility of recovery. Then in this case, can the bank go back on old ways where the phone gets locked if you do not pay EMI. Also, the way the valid handle of SEBI is launched in which if I am paying money to a fraud then I will get to know that this is fraud and not registered under SEBI. So, if there is any platform in which if I am transferring money then I will get to know that this is a fraud account or I am getting stuck in it… Sanjay Malhotra: Three questions. First one is if any charges are going to be levied on UPI. We have no such proposal in front of us. Second you said that if the mobile phone loan is given to purchase it, then can we give permission to lock it or not, the way it is given for auto loans etc. This case is under study. We are getting responses from both sides. We are taking cognisance of the same. Our effort is that our consumers’ rights and data privacy should be protected. Consumer interest and their wellbeing is the top most priority and at the same time how can we protect the lenders’ interest as well - that matter is still under study. Your third question was about fraud, which is a very serious matter, and we have taken a lot of steps toward that. It is our continuous endeavor to find a way to stop the money transfer from one account to another in a fraudulent manner. On the same way we have told you about MuleHunter and in similar way we are now doing another experiment; we have not implemented it completely. We are preparing software to gather all the information at the beginning of the transaction so that we can warn our consumers that this is a risky transaction - do not proceed with this transaction we are trying for that. I would ask our DG to explain the same thing in English. And regarding your second question regarding mobile phone, I would ask DG MRR to translate it in English. T Rabi Sankar: No, I will not try to translate what the Governor said, but yes, it is basically this. The digital payments intelligence platform - you would recall that RBI had set up a group, it had announced. We are now implementing it. As the Governor said, the actual prototype is getting developed by our Innovation Hub. An entity is being set up to run this. The basic idea behind this platform is that you collect information from whatever sources are available, mule accounts, telecoms, geography, where the call is coming from and whatever information is available. You have an AI system which is being trained on this information. The idea is that this system will alert before a transaction by saying that this transaction is risky. Now, based on the alert, the customer will have to take a call, or the bank will have to take a call. We expect that this will have a significant impact in terms of reducing the number of frauds that we see in the system. By no means, I am saying that the number of frauds are high. The number of frauds are well under control. If you look at number of frauds per transactions in UPI and others, they are quite low, but these systems will further lower those transactions. Thank you. M. Rajeshwar Rao: Issue of digital locking, which I think I had referred to. I think the issue is under examination as Governor has pointed out. There are pros and cons on both sides in terms of balancing the customer rights and requirements, data privacy, and also the creditors' requirements. We are examining the issue. We will evaluate the pros and cons and then take a view at a later point in time. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sirs. Next, I will ask Ms. Sangita Mehta from Economic Times. Sangita, please. Sangita Mehta, Economic Times: Thank you, sir. Sir, my question is on forms of business. You all have relaxed the guidelines, and you have said that the board of the banks will have the discretion to decide. Why has RBI chosen to relax the norms? And sir, one more thing on this, what would be the specific macro-prudential tools that you would be using for larger exposure framework? Sanjay Malhotra: So, first thing you are saying relaxation. Let me first of all clarify that that was only a draft. It was not a final kind of guideline or a direction. So, the other thing is, see, we do not want to micromanage. We believe that the banks will take a conscious, considered, balanced view depending on their needs as to how they wish to conduct their own business. And so, that is why we have just left it to them. Second question was, what would be the macro-prudential tools, we have number of them, I will leave it to DG MRR. M. Rajeshwar Rao: We have number of tools which are available. May be we can look at, say, putting a cap on the exposure from all the banks because I think the fundamental point which Governor mentioned was the concentration risk. All the banks collective exposure to a single entity. So, we could think of limits for that, but that is something which can be considered at a particular point in time if appropriate. Sanjay Malhotra: And then we have supervision also. We can also put in supervisory measures in case required. Sangita Mehta, Economic Times: But this will be draft first. Sanjay Malhotra: Yes. This is final now. M. Rajeshwar Rao: Forms of business is final. Sanjay Malhotra: Forms of business is final. Sangita Mehta, Economic Times: No, the large credit… M. Rajeshwar Rao: That is a draft circular, sir. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sirs. Next, we will have Mr. Ashish Agashe from PTI. Ashish Agashe, PTI: Thank you so much, sir. A quick follow-up to Vishwanath and Swati's questions. Earlier, there was a perception that financial stability sort of foregrounds RBI's approach on things. Are we to now understand that it is a sort of turn towards being more pragmatic? And sir second quick question. So, how do you look at these adverse weather events right now, since the last policy, there have been more. So, how do you look at this from an inflation and growth perspective? Sanjay Malhotra: I do not think that you should see these measures as any kind of relaxation or kind of letting go our sight from financial stability. Stability is foremost for us. Whether it is price stability, whether it is financial stability, that is foremost not only for us, I think for the country as a whole. It is very, very important because if you do not have price stability, there are consequences. Similarly, financial stability, one episode of financial instability can take you many years behind. So, all of us need to be very conscious of that. At the same time, we have to ensure that we are not in any ways impeding growth or limiting whatever are the fulfilment of the genuine requirements of the various productive sectors of our economy. So, financial stability, price stability will continue to be the primary focus of the Reserve Bank as it is for all other central banks as well. Weather related events, yes, they do have an impact on both growth and on inflation. There have been a number of them. At the same time, let us also keep in mind that the government has also put in place a number of measures. Now, the supply chain management is much better, and they are able to respond to them better. So, that is why we have seen that over the years, despite there being more weather-related events, as you mentioned, inflation has been much better behaved. It is lower in the last 10 years vis-a-vis earlier 10 years. So, at the same time, we will also do whatever is required for the health of our banking system to be able to take care of any weather or climate-related risks. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next question will be from Mr. Ankur Mishra from ET Now. Ankur please. Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Thank you so much for the opportunity. Hello, sir. I want to ask you regarding the rupee depreciation, which you have mentioned in the policy also. You will take measures as and when required. In the MPR, the revision of exchange rate has been there from 86 to 88 this time. I want to understand from you, is the current exchange rate comfortable for you? And also talking about MPR, you have made projections for inflation also 4.5%. In that context, keeping the neutral rates and talking about the real rates here, it is below the estimate. How much of the scope of then easing is there for you? Sanjay Malhotra: What is below the estimate? Ankur Mishra: ET Now: Real rate. 4.5% is the projection which has been given in the MPR. Sanjay Malhotra: Okay. So, your first question was on? Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Rupee. Sanjay Malhotra: So, rupee, see we do not, you asked me whether you are comfortable with this rate, etc. So, we do not target any level or any price band. Our effort has been to manage any undue volatility, and we will continue to do so. Insofar as you are saying the real rate is concerned going forward, you are saying this 4.5%, that is in Q1. So, there are a number of things which go into it, and it is not only inflation that we have to look at, we have to also look at growth in our overall macro, in our monetary policy. And so, based on that, we have continued to retain the policy repo rate at 5.5% and the stance at neutral. Ankur Mishra, ET Now: Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Mr. Mahesh from Financial Express. Mahesh Nayak, Financial Express: Thank you, sir. With all these measures taken, are you still seeing any green shoots in the capex happening in this country, especially with the large corporates, apart from the infrastructure and the renewable sector? Sanjay Malhotra: We had a good number in Q1; we had a good healthy number. A lot of sectors, we are seeing good demand. I think, cement for example, auto, a lot of other sectors - they are seeing a good demand for capex. And on the whole, we are confident that capex will further going forward revive, private capex will revive. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Sir, next, it will be Mr. Aaryan from Informist Media. Aaryan, please. Aaryan Khanna, Informist Media: Thank you, sir. This question is for both the Governor and DG Gupta, if possible. The MPC resolution said that the MPC was waiting for the impact of prior steps to take further action on rates. Eventually, the transmission of the prior actions will take place. Considering your growth and inflation forecast for the next few quarters - what do you think will stop you from cutting rates, especially considering the real and nominal GDP? The real and nominal GDP numbers in the June quarter painted very different pictures of the economy. Thank you, sir. Poonam Gupta: As you know, monetary policy is a forward-looking response. So, while Q1 numbers have actually been surprisingly good, as you said, but there is some softness projected in the second half of the year. And inflation numbers have also been surprisingly very, very benign. So, I guess taking into account both of those developments, as we said in the statement, some room has opened, but it has to be contextualised with everything else that is happening both domestically and globally. So, it is a fast evolving, very, very fluid situation. Yes, Q1 numbers have been good, but those are only one factor in the number of things that we consider for monetary policy action. And that is an important factor, but it is a backward-looking factor. So, to that extent, there is room. But as has been said and has been also repeated by Sir, a number of other things will be taken into account before deciding the next action in December. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, ma'am. Next, we will have Mr. Lalatendu Mishra from The Hindu. Lalatendu Mishra, The Hindu: Good afternoon, Governor. You have partly answered my question that I will be asking. This is about the impact of the tariff on the Indian economy. Have the RBI or the MPC mapped the impact into different sectors? Thank you, sir. Sanjay Malhotra: Yes, we have the map. We have the details. You are aware which are the sectors - gems & jewellery, shrimps, textiles, now may be a little bit of, very little extent, generic branded pharma, which has now come in later, footwear. These are the primary sectors which will be impacted. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. Next, we will have Ms. Subhana from The Mint. Subhana Shaikh, The Mint: Hi, sir. So, sir, I wanted to go back to the first question on monetary policy transmission. You said that there has been an impact of yields – they have gone up by 30 to 35 basis points. Now, that has gone up since the June monetary policy and we have seen some headwinds on monetary policy transmission, so what is it that, is RBI concerned about this monetary policy transmission getting impacted through the bond channel? In your assessment, would you bring back OMOs or G-Sec purchases? In what way would you signal to ensure the market that the policy repo rate adjustments would feed through long-term rates? Sanjay Malhotra: See, the primary tool that we have for monetary policy transmission is the policy repo rate and align the policy, the operational target, which is our weighted average call rate (WACR) to the policy repo rate. Last month, it was at 5.46%. There has been broad-based transmission, as I mentioned to you, across all sectors - whether it is money markets, bank credit, even corporate bonds. Corporate bonds five-year AAA corporate bonds are down from their peak by 50 basis points. And similarly, you know, for other bonds also. Similarly, for government securities also. It is a process. It takes time and we are hopeful that the transmission will take place even in other sectors. Please also keep in mind that even in 10-year (bond), as I mentioned, it is about 25-30 basis points. Only because of monetary policy, it had decreased by even more, 60 basis points. There have been certain developments after that. The other thing is 10-year G-sec will not move one is to one. Let us keep that also in mind. 25-30 basis points, while there is scope for more, and we feel that it should head downward, a number of measures have been contemplated in this regard, including how the primary G-Sec auctions will be held. The tenor of these government offerings, not only central government as well as state government, we are quite confident that monetary policy transmission has already happened to a great extent and will continue going forward. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. From the left-hand side itself, Mr. Benn from The New Indian Express. Benn, please. Benn Kochuveedan, The New Indian Express: Hi, sir. One is a complaint or a suggestion. The RBI statements and releases are coming too late these days and too many bunches. It could be given on a reasonable time; can’t we do a better job on that. Like the banking, the seven regulation changes, it came at 10:20 (pm). Or the last bulletin came at 11:30 (pm) or something, it is beyond our capacity to manage. Sanjay Malhotra: We work 24x7. I get the point, and we will endeavour that we bring them out, what time do you want them out? Latha Venkatesh, CNBC TV-18: After 6 is fine. Sanjay Malhotra: By 6, okay. We will issue all whatever documents, press releases primarily, regulations by 6 pm. And if anything is getting delayed beyond 6 pm, then will issue it next day. Right. Fair point. Benn Kochuveedan, The New Indian Express: Sir, my question is, I know RBI does not name individual entities, it is regulated. But this is about the Tata Sons application, which was submitted last year - last August to seeking the de-registration of their NBFC licence. Sanjay Malhotra: Individual entities. We do not comment on individual matters. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you. Sir, next we will have Mr. Piyush from The Hindu Business Line. Piyush, please. Piyush Shukla, The Hindu Business Line: Good afternoon, sir, DGs. Thanks, Puneet ji. Sir, you had issued discussion paper on FIT framework. The deadline for public feedback has gone last year, last month. What is the sort of suggestions that you have received - whether to stick with headline or core, narrowing the band? And by when can we expect, because it is supposed to be implemented from March next year, one? Sanjay Malhotra: Which one? Piyush Shulka, The Hindu Business Line: Flexible inflation Targeting. Sanjay Malhotra: Okay. Piyush Shulka, The Hindu Business Line: Separately, there are over 2,000 urban cooperative banks in the country. We have seen over the past year that there have been governance issues at some of these which has led to substantial fraud and depositors getting hurt. What is the rationale for giving new licences to UCBs? Or do you feel there is still financial inclusion, that penetration is still yet to be done. And just a follow-up to Benn sir’s question, we understand that you do not comment on entities, but this deadline was supposed to be yesterday. So, now what happens? Now, they are non-compliant. So, what is the view we take? Sanjay Malhotra: So, your first question on FIT. See, that is a discussion paper. We have got various suggestions and basis those suggestions, we will now finalise our recommendations as per the provisions of the amended Act. And we will send our recommendations to the government. This was a public consultation. We did so as to enable all stakeholders to participate in the formulation of our views. Our views will be communicated to the government. But we will take into account all views that have come to us. The final decision will be with the government. Second question on UCBs, it is a discussion paper, first of all. So, it has been 21 years, as I said, in the spirit of review, a lot of developments have happened. Banking Regulation Act itself has brought a number of areas, including governance now under the supervision and regulation of the Reserve Bank of India, number of positive developments have happened. After that, however, whether to open up licensing again or not, and if to do it with what guardrails is a question that we will be putting for all of you to respond to and to comment on. And only thereafter, we will be taking a view on it. Thank you. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. A couple of questions from the right-hand side, sir. We will have Mr. Krishn Kaushik from Financial Times. Krishna, please. Krishn Kaushik, Financial Times: Thank you, sir. I had the same question that was asked over there. Sir, for Tata Sons, because the deadline has come and passed, does it mean that they have got an exemption for now for floating an IPO? I know it is not a single entity question; it is a policy question because they have not floated the IPO, yet the deadline has passed. Sanjay Malhotra: See, as I mentioned, we do not comment on any specific entities. Any entity which has a registration till it is not cancelled, any entity will continue to do its business. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. And lastly, we will have Mr. Soumyajit Saha from Nikkei. Soumyajit Saha, Nikkei: Hello, Governor. We wanted to talk about the rupee because some of the predictions from the more bearish economists is that a further weakening may be expected over the next few months. There is obviously some benefits coming out of that when it comes to export competitiveness, but there is also the public sentiment side of things. It is something that is often sentimental or even politicised. We just want to understand how the RBI looks at public sentiment around the weakening of the rupee or any such movement. Does that kind of feature in the way you think about it in your considerations of your actions? How important is the public sentiment there? Sanjay Malhotra: See, as I mentioned, we do not target any level, any band. If there is any public opinion, etc., we suppose that gets factored in, in the prices of the rupee. But we do not push or target any band. We only try to maintain, remove any undue abnormal volatility. And we have sufficient reserves, as I already mentioned. There is no reason why it should impact the sentiments or emotions of the public. Puneet Pancholy: Thank you, sir. With this, we come to the close of this press conference. Sir, thank you and thanks to all the top management for answering all the questions and making this very interactive. I thank all the media participants for being here and I wish you all a pleasant day. Thank you.",

      "summary": "Secretary, DFS, Shri M. Nagaraju, other senior officials from the Government, Chairman and MDs of SBI, MD CEOs and EDs of Public Sector Banks, and my other colleagues, a very good morning to all of you. 2. I am honoured to be here at PSB Manthan 2025. Personally, this gathering feels like a homecoming, a return to a familiar space of dialogue and shared purpose, where the concerns, aspirations, and vision of our public sector banks take centre-stage. 3. The very word Manthan or churning has timeless symbolism in our traditions. It reminds us that progress rarely comes easily; it requires effort, reflection, and perseverance. Much like a family coming together to deliberate and debate for the common good, PSB Manthan brings together policymakers, regulators, and bankers to churn our collective experiences and insights so that we may draw out the nectar of transformation. 4. I commend the Department of Financial Services for nurturing this platform over the years, and for ensuring that it continues to evolve as a space where ideas are debated, challenges are confronted, and the future course of PSBs is shaped with collective wisdom. The Context: Resilience amidst Global Headwinds 5. We meet today at a time when the global environment remains marked by uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions, shifting trade alignments, climate transitions, and rapid technological disruptions are reshaping the contours of growth and finance worldwide. 6. Yet, amidst these headwinds, the Indian economy continues to demonstrate resilience and stability. This confidence is not only evident in domestic sentiment but has also been reinforced by global assessments, most recently the upgrade of India’s sovereign rating outlook by S&P. 7. Much of this resilience rests on the strength of our banking system. Over the past decade, Indian banks, and particularly our public sector banks, have undergone a remarkable turnaround. Balance sheets have been repaired, capital strengthened, and asset quality improved. At the same time, PSBs have deepened their traditional role as anchors of financial inclusion while also keeping pace with the wider digital transformation of the sector. Their contribution to Jan Dhan Yojana, to direct benefit transfers, and to the expansion of UPI in semi-urban and rural centres, reflects how PSBs combine scale with reach to serve the real economy. 8. Periods of comfort, however, can create the risk of complacency and mistakes are typically made in good times. Therefore, the challenge before PSBs today is not only to stay clear of the earlier shortcomings but to build on the gains of the past decade and transform themselves further. PSBs have to remain strong, adaptable, and future-ready to contribute meaningfully to the vision of a Viksit Bharat by 2047. The Banyan Tree Metaphor: Transforming PSBs from providers of stability to enablers of new growth 9. As we reflect on what this transformation entails, I am reminded of a powerful symbol from our own banking history. Many of you will recall that when the State Bank of India was established in 1955, its logo was a sprawling banyan tree. The choice was deliberate, for the banyan has long been revered as the tree of life. its deep roots embody stability, its sturdy trunk represents resilience, and its wide canopy offers protection to all. 10. In later years, however, the banyan tree logo was replaced by the now familiar blue circle with a keyhole, designed by the National Institute of Design 1 . While the banyan conveyed strength and shade, it also drew criticism for casting such a dense canopy that little else could grow beneath it, which seemed at odds with the image of a modern and accessible bank. 11. Today, for the PSBs, the task is not only to provide shade and shelter to millions of households and enterprises but also to ensure that beneath their canopy, new growth flourishes in the form of abundant and affordable credit to MSMEs, start-ups, women entrepreneurs, and rural enterprises. 12. In that spirit, I find the banyan tree still a fitting metaphor for our PSBs. Its roots, trunk, aerial roots, branches , and canopy together capture the five pillars on which PSBs can build their future. These five pillars in today’s context are strong governance, financial resilience, innovation and adaptability, people and culture, and an all inclusive customer-centricity. Deep Roots: Governance and Assurance – evolve to meet new risks 13. The banyan tree can survive storms because of its deep roots. They may not be visible, but they are the true source of its longevity and stability. For banks, these roots are strong governance and assurance. 14. It means boards that are engaged, leadership that is accountable, and decisions that are transparent and ethical. Regulation can guide, but governance must come from within. Supervisory intervention can fix, but it cannot substitute for an internal culture of integrity. 15. The assurance functions, including risk management, compliance and internal audit, give depth and resilience to governance. They provide boards with independent and reliable perspectives, helping them act with foresight rather than hindsight. 16. Governance today must also evolve with changing times. Boards need sharper tools, such as real-time insights that flag emerging risks or customer concerns. As banks adopt artificial intelligence and data driven systems, assurance must also extend to these new domains. Ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in automated decisions is becoming as important as monitoring credit or operational risk. 17. Deep roots allow a tree not only to survive but also to nurture new growth. In the same way, strong governance supported by robust assurance will allow banks to take on fresh initiatives with confidence, knowing that these are built on a stable foundation of trust. The Sturdy Trunk: Financial Strength and Resilience 18. The trunk of the banyan tree stands tall and sturdy, holding the entire tree together through calm and storm. For our banks, the trunk is financial strength and resilience. 19. Over the past decade, PSBs have strengthened their capital position and improved asset quality. These gains must now be protected and deepened. Banks should hold forward looking capital buffers that reflect their risk profile and growth ambitions rather than simply complying with regulatory floors. Asset quality must also be managed with a preventive mindset, using early warning systems and predictive analytics to identify stress before it becomes a crisis. 20. True resilience today goes beyond capital and credit. It also means operational resilience. With customers relying on banks for 24x7 digital access, even short disruptions can erode trust and create systemic impact. Banks must therefore strengthen their technology infrastructure, cyber safeguards, vendor oversight, and business continuity planning so that services remain secure and uninterrupted under every circumstance. 21. A strong trunk allows the tree to support new branches and new growth. For PSBs, resilience both financial and operational is what will allow them to expand and support India’s development priorities with confidence. Aerial Roots of Renewal: Innovation and Adaptability – for an open, adaptive, tech driven banking 22. The banyan tree constantly sends down aerial roots, which in time become fresh pillars of support. For our banks, these aerial roots are innovation and adaptability. 23. In today’s financial landscape, technology is no longer optional. Modernising core IT systems and adopting advanced analytics are essential to remain competitive. AI/ML can strengthen fraud detection, improve credit assessment, and personalise customer engagement. 24. Innovation is not just about new tools. It is also about smarter ways of delivering them. PSBs should consider shared technology platforms and joint development of digital infrastructure to leverage economies of scale, reduce costs, and ensure consistency in customer experience. They can also experiment with what is known as a digital twin 2 , a virtual model that mirrors a real process such as the working of a branch or the journey of a customer applying for a loan. By testing changes on the digital twin first, banks can identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency before making changes in the real world. 25. Adaptability also means openness to new partnerships. Collaborating with FinTechs including the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), and using other open banking interfaces can bring the best of both worlds - the reach and trust of PSBs combined with the agility of innovators. 26. Yet, greater reliance on technology inevitably increases vulnerability. Cybersecurity, vendor oversight, and business continuity must therefore be built into every digital initiative by design. 27. Aerial roots renew the strength of the banyan tree and allow it to spread further. For PSBs, continuous innovation and adaptability will ensure that their canopy remains relevant, and that fresh growth can thrive beneath it. Living Branches and Leaves: People and Culture – from process-oriented service to empathetic people centric culture 28. The branches and leaves are what people first notice when they see a banyan tree. For banks, they represent employees who bring strategy to life through everyday actions. 29. A large, committed workforce remain the most valuable asset of PSBs, even in an age of artificial intelligence. No algorithm can replace trust, empathy, and human judgment. To keep the branches strong, investment in human capital is vital. Staff must be equipped with new skills in digital banking, cybersecurity, and analytics. Training should be practical and engaging, including simulation-based learning. 30. Equally important is staff attitude and culture. Every customer should feel respected, not merely processed or attended to. True service comes from an empathetic customer first approach. PSBs must therefore nurture a culture of professionalism, empathy, and accountability so that their people remain the strongest ambassadors of trust. The Canopy of Trust and Inclusion – from transaction driven banking to customer centric, trust-based inclusion 31. The canopy of the banyan provides shade to all. For PSBs, it represents their enduring role in customer centricity and financial inclusion. From Jan Dhan to direct benefit transfers, from self-help groups to MSME lending, PSBs have given millions of Indians financial dignity. This role must continue and evolve, for today’s customers expect not just access but also convenience, speed, and fairness. Meeting these expectations requires services that are transparent and responsive. 32. Customer centricity begins with trust. Every complaint is a test of confidence. By not giving room for complaints and by resolving issues, when they arise, promptly and fairly, banks can strengthen that trust and ensure that customers feel empowered in every interaction. Conclusion 33. In villages, it is under the banyan tree that people gather to seek counsel, to deliberate, and to find shade in times of need. In much the same way, citizens look to PSBs not only for loans and deposits but also for inclusion, stability, security, and progress. Let us commit to nurturing this banyan tree so that it remains a symbol of trust and resilience and contributes decisively to the realisation of a Viksit Bharat by 2047. Thank you.

      "summary": "Distinguished guests, participants, ladies and gentlemen, a very good evening. I am delighted to address this august gathering of distinguished persons, and key stakeholders across the financial spectrum in the banking transformation summit on the theme of ‘Banking That Builds Bharat: AI-Powered, Credit-Driven’, which is extremely contextual and relevant and encapsulates the spirit of Viksit Bharat . Introduction 2. The Indian banking system has time and again exhibited its capability to embrace and adapt to newer technologies. Beginning from the early days of computerization in the 1980s, to spread of ATMs in the 1990s, the expansion of internet and mobile banking in the 2000s, interoperable infrastructure for payments, data repositories and data sharing since 2010s, the banking sector has adapted successfully to the requirements of the changing times and has over the period made banking more efficient and inclusive. Banking has now entered into a new phase of evolution driven by digital democratization. A prime example is the homegrown Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which has made India a global leader in digital payments which reinforces our belief that responsible innovation can be a powerful driver of progress. 3. The Government of India has articulated an ambitious vision of “Viksit Bharat” i.e., transforming India into a developed country by 2047. This sets the tone for the next step in our technological journey of financial sector and more specifically, in the banking sector. Under Viksit Bharat, the goal is for every adult to not only have a bank account, a target largely achieved under Jan Dhan Yojana 2 , but also have access to affordable credit, insurance, and investment options. The endeavour of banking sector should be to ensure that benefits of banking, more so of credit accessibility, is made available to customers across all segments on a fair, transparent and affordable basis. Measures taken by RBI 4. In last five years, between 2019-20 to 2024-25, the bank credit growth has been averaging around 10.5 percent 3 . It is also seen that the share of retail credit has grown to 33 per cent 4 while the share of credit to Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector has been growing steadily, forming 18 per cent of total bank credit as of March 2025. Before delving into the role of new technologies, let me briefly first touch upon the steps taken by RBI over the years to increase flow of credit. 5. The RBI has undertaken several measures to expand both the reach and depth of credit by reducing friction, increasing access points, and lowering the cost of financial service delivery. Key initiatives include Aadhaar-based KYC, the Central KYC Registry, the revised Priority Sector Lending norms, Partial Credit Enhancement Guidelines, and the Account Aggregator framework 5 . In response to the growing digitalisation of credit, the Digital Lending Guidelines 6 were introduced to ensure transparency, fairness, data privacy, while enabling fund flow to wider sectors. The RBI has also enabled formal credit access through frameworks like Trade Receivables e-Discounting System (TReDS) for MSMEs, co-lending models between banks and NBFCs, and targeted refinancing schemes. 6. More recently, the RBI has, in collaboration with its subsidiary RBI Innovation Hub (RBIH), tested a prototype of the Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit 7 to enable seamless digital data flow to lenders. Building on this, the Unified Lending Interface (ULI) 8 is being developed to transform credit delivery by integrating access to both financial and non-financial data such as digitised land records, Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) data, property records, and satellite data along with services like e-KYC, the Account Aggregator framework, and Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE). This ecosystem aims to make lending faster, cheaper, and more accessible to underserved segments. Together, this digital public infrastructure and an enabling regulatory framework would help to drive inclusive credit growth. Gaps in access to formal credit 7. Having said that, a lot of distance still needs to be traversed, as the gap in credit penetration persists. Even today, only around 25 per cent of India’s adult population have formal access to institutional credit 9 while in the MSME sector (which forms ~30 per cent of GDP) 10 , only part of their credit needs is met by formal institutions 11 . While the Financial Inclusion Index developed by RBI has shown steady improvement, rising from 53.9 in March 2021 to 67.0 in March 2025 12 reflecting the growth in account ownership and credit access, scope remains in effecting improvement in the usage and quality of services delivered. The gap between inclusion and credit access is a challenge and an opportunity to banking fraternity. The credit needs to not only grow in terms of volume and numbers but also needs to be directed towards productive, sectors that deliver higher multipliers such as MSMEs, infrastructure, informal sectors, and rural population, to achieve not just the goal of “ Viksit Bharat ” but to have a “ Samaveshi Viksit Bharat” . The new wave in banking- Artificial Intelligence 8. Driving the next credit revolution will require harnessing new technologies. Over time, the role of technology in finance has shifted from improving operational efficiency to fully automating and centralizing previously manual, fragmented processes. Among emerging technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands out for its vast potential from strengthening internal operations and risk management to delivering faster, more seamless customer experiences. Reports indicate that nearly 70% of Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) organisations in India have an enterprise level AI strategy in FY 2024 13 . An RBI study of banks’ annual reports also shows a sharp rise in references to AI, underscoring its growing strategic importance 14 . While both demand-side factors (profitability, competition, compliance efficiency) and supply-side drivers (tech advances, data growth, new business models) influence AI adoption, supply-side forces remain the primary catalyst. 9. AI as a discipline has evolved over decades and has seen rise of machine learning systems which can learn from historical data to make decisions, often with high accuracy. Indian banks and non-banks, embarked on AI journey nearly a decade ago, mainly handling at that time, large volume of information and supplementary analysis which added value without displacing established systems. The adoption has since moved from deployment of AI for back-office functions for efficiency enhancements to more varied use cases such as in the areas of fraud risk management, optimising IT operations, facial recognition for KYC, credit scoring, claim processing, and customer focused services. As observed in the surveys conducted by RBI in 2023 and 2024 15 , more than three-fourth of the banks have deployed AI-powered chatbots for customer service. This marks a fundamental shift in which AI is no longer just an enabler but a part of the decision-making process, product design, and customer engagement. AI across the credit lifecycle 10. Though, the banks have been using AI in some areas of lending, there is potential use cases for its usage across other areas of the credit lifecycle. I would like to highlight a few of them: (i) Credit Inclusion 11. An important use case would be in the way credit is assessed and distributed. This would require supplementing existing assessment methods with broader data based and more refined analysis, whereby financial institutions could gain additional perspectives on risk and capability of the potential borrowers. This would be a significant game changer to address the credit requirement of the millions of “credit invisibles”, i.e., people with no formal credit history or new to credit customers. Given the availability of a variety of digital footprints which customers have, AI can be leveraged to peruse alternative data sets, to assess their creditworthiness. This would mean a paradigm shift from asset-based lending to cash-flow and alternate data-based lending, promoting a journey towards inclusive digital finance. Government of India also has recognised the potential of alternate data to drive financial inclusion and has started initiatives such as the “Grameen Credit Score” 16 which aims to provide underserved communities with formal credit access by analyzing alternative financial data, including UPI transactions, government subsidy receipts, and utility payments. (ii) Turnaround Time 12. AI enables banks to process large volumes of customer data quickly, accelerating credit decisions and service delivery. This is especially valuable in time-sensitive sectors like MSME working capital, where AI can analyse diverse datasets like bank statements, payment histories, GST filings, e-invoices, TReDS receivables, and public records. It also aids lenders in assessing seasonality, supply chains, inventory cycles, customer concentration, and overall creditworthiness of MSMEs. (iii) Credit Appraisals 13. The banks can embrace AI algorithms for leveraging behavioural analytics by analysing vast amounts of transactional data for detecting patterns indicative of creditworthiness and stable financial behaviour, leading to more accurate credit assessments and improved decision-making processes. (iv) Customized Credit Solutions 14. AI’s ability to dynamically assess customer preferences and behaviour can empower banks to offer customized credit solutions tailored to an individual’s financial capacity. This not only improves loan accessibility but also ensures that borrowers receive fair and structured financial products that align with their needs. (v) Early Warning Signals and Provisioning 15. AI-based early warning systems can help lenders monitor credit portfolios more effectively through dynamic risk scoring and real-time default probability tracking. By flagging early signs of financial stress, these systems protect the lender’s balance sheet while giving borrowers a chance to course-correct. The goal, ultimately, is not just to lend more but to lend better. (vi) Document Management 16. AI also plays a key role in automating document verification by using techniques like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read and process information from documents – especially handwritten documents which are generally unstructured, allowing for automated extraction of data thus reducing rejections. It can also examine the visual characteristics of the documents to detect forgery, tampering, or modifications and accurately process large volumes of records, classifying, extracting, and validating key data, thereby improving efficiency and minimizing errors in the lending process. (vii) Customer Support and Grievance Redress 17. One promising use case of AI is the development of multilingual chatbots and voice assistants which enable customers to interact with banks in their native language. This is a revolutionary change as by localizing the user experience, the AI can enable more people across different languages, literacy levels, and abilities to confidently use formal banking services. 18. Banks are also experimenting with using AI powered virtual assistants to enable staff to respond to customer queries which can enhance customer experience. Timely resolution of customer queries boosts trust in the banking system and encourages deeper engagement, furthering financial inclusion. As digital access has expanded, so has customer complaints. This highlights another use case for AI. It can efficiently categorize, prioritize, and route complaints, enabling faster, proactive resolution by detecting patterns and addressing root causes before issues escalate into grievances. (viii) Loan Servicing 19. AI-powered loan servicing platforms can create personalised repayment solutions and reduce operational errors across servicing and portfolio management. They can also provide new ways of loan servicing by supporting collections and recovery through prioritised outreach strategies. AI can help to strengthen compliance with auditable trails of measures initiated for recovery. (ix) Fraud Risk Management and Cyber Security 20. AI also holds potential in safeguarding the financial system itself. As cybercriminals increasingly use AI for sophisticated attacks, Regulated Entities (REs) can leverage AI-driven tools to protect customers and detect threats. AI can monitor large transaction volumes in real time, flagging anomalies that may assist in detecting fraud or money laundering. Collaboration for Credit Revolution 21. With fintechs advancing rapidly, REs are increasingly partnering with them across the credit lifecycle. A key model—Digital Lending, involves embedding processes like KYC, credit assessment, and collection directly into fintech platforms. While such collaborations enhance financial inclusion and innovation, they also bring risks such as blurred accountability, data misuse, inadequate grievance redressal, and potential mis-selling. The guiding principle to address this remains the premise that regardless of the model used, accountability ultimately rests with the regulated entity. Risks and challenges of AI - New dimensions and the Ethical imperative 22. Technological advancements come with challenges that REs must recognize, as these risks can undermine the benefits of innovation. For example, the recent Supreme Court ruling 17 on video-based e-KYC highlighted that mandatory automated processes may create barriers for people with disabilities, underscoring the need for fairness and accessibility in technology adoption to avoid exclusions. AI, without proper controls, can introduce risks like algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, ethical concerns, and systemic vulnerabilities. It can also amplify existing risks such as third-party dependencies, concentration, model, cyber, and data privacy risks. Let me highlight a few: (i) Third-party dependency 23. As AI adoption grows, financial institutions increasingly rely on complex networks of external providers, cloud platforms, AI vendors, and data aggregators. These interdependencies create vulnerabilities where a disruption or breach in one link can cascade across multiple institutions, disrupting critical services. The complexity and opacity of these layers makes it difficult to identify risks, which may accumulate unnoticed and spread rapidly during shocks. (ii) Market Correlation 24. A critical vulnerability of AI is its potential to synchronize behaviors across the financial system. When institutions use similar models trained on overlapping data, their decisions on asset pricing, credit assessment, trading, and others may align, creating hidden linkages. This can amplify market stress, spread shocks rapidly, worsen liquidity shortages, increase asset price volatility, and trigger sharp, self-reinforcing market swings. (iii) Cyber Risk 25. The integration of AI into financial systems—especially through new interaction methods and increased reliance on specialized providers expands the cyber threat landscape in unpredictable ways. AI’s strengths, such as reliance on large datasets, open interfaces, and automated decisions, also create vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can exploit these through adversarial attacks or compromised training data, potentially corrupting AI outputs. Even a single breach can disrupt critical operations across multiple REs and undermine trust in AI across the sector. (iv) Model Risk 26. Unlike traditional models built on clear rules and well laid out assumptions, AI models operate through dense, opaque algorithms, which we also refer to as “black boxes” and evolve with the data they consume. This introduces the risk of prejudice within models where biased data, opaque design, or untested assumptions may lead to biased outcomes of model. Such distortions can lead to unfair credit assessment, excluding deserving segments, or conversely extending credit where risks are understated. (v) Data Risk 27. AI is only as strong as the data that shapes it and this leads to a host of vulnerabilities emanating from data quality. Currently, while most of the financial data is structured, much of it is fragmented across systems, often in inconsistent formats, sometimes incomplete or outdated, or skewed by historical biases. When such data flows into AI models, it can produce results that may appear authentic, but suboptimal and in some cases may produce wrong outputs. Over-reliance on such models can quietly turn data gaps into large-scale misjudgments and wrong business decisions. (vi) Legal Certainty and Intellectual Property Right issues 28. AI models are often trained on publicly available data, like news stories, articles, and explainer videos, etc., and may lead to intellectual property and copyright infringements. (vii) Concentration Risk 29. Reserve Bank’s Financial Stability Report 18 has pointed out the high market concentration in critical third-party providers of cloud/ AI services, noting that heavy reliance on a small number of tech players could create single points of failure. Such concentration risks are compounded by the vertical integration of certain providers, who supply not just models but also the underlying infrastructure and datasets. (viii) Frauds and disinformation 30. While AI is transforming many of the processes of financial institutions, the rise of Generative AI has also lowered the barriers for fraud, putting powerful deception tools in the hands of malicious actors. Deepfakes can mimic voices, faces, and documents with unsettling accuracy, while AI-generated phishing lures, fake identities, and forged credentials can slip past traditional checks. 31. In light of these multi-faceted risks, some of which I have touched upon, it becomes crucial that adoption of AI in banking sector must be done in a responsible and measured manner. The excitement around AI’s benefits should not overshadow prudent risk management. In this context, the following aspects become even more crucial. (i) Governance 32. A robust governance is indispensable for ensuring the integrity of data, the reliability of models, and mitigating the risks associated with adoption of AI. The financial institutions should have in place a comprehensive strategy for AI adoption. It should be accompanied by clear policies, risk appetites, criticality, and impact assessments as well as ethical standards that cascade through the organisation. Robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms should be put in place to ensure alignment between innovation goals and institutional stability. Further, in a regulated industry like banking, it is essential to understand how a model arrives at its decisions, making explainability a critical requirement. Thus, there is a need for financial institutions to invest in Explainable AI frameworks that provide clear, auditable reasons for loan decisions. Strong governance is central to managing AI-driven model risk. (ii) Human-in-the-loop 33. While AI can automate and recommend, the humans should be responsible for the decisions. The financial institutions while adopting AI for business processes should implement the principle of human-in the-loop to ensure that AI is leveraged as a tool to support and enhance human decisions and not replace them. (iii) Maintaining Data quality and security 34. High-quality data is the backbone of safe and effective AI in finance. While the RBI already collects data through supervisory reports, regulatory returns, and surveys, the introduction of model risk guidelines, aligned with global best practices, will soon extend this scope to include data on AI models used by regulated entities. Financial institutions should therefore adopt robust data strategies, incorporating diverse, reliable indicators that reflect both the scale of AI adoption and associated vulnerabilities. 35. When AI is used for credit decisioning or financial inclusion, especially through alternative data, customer data becomes central, making privacy and security paramount. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 provides the legal framework for responsible data use, and financial institutions must ensure compliance through consent-based, privacy-first data handling practices. (iv) Research and Development 36. Continued investment in research and development is critical for advancing the capabilities of AI in lending lifecycle for unlocking new opportunities. Research efforts of the financial institutions should focus on improving data quality and accessibility, developing novel AI algorithms for enhancing credit inclusion, and addressing key challenges related to bias, fairness, and interpretability in credit evaluation as well as enhancement of in-house capabilities to manage concentration risk of providers. (v) Industry Collaborations 37. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing among industry stakeholders, including financial institutions, fintech companies, and academic institutions is essential for driving innovation and addressing common challenges in AI-driven credit processes. This can foster the development of best practices, standards, and frameworks for responsible AI use, promoting transparency, fairness, and accountability in credit evaluation. Some of the initial areas where the industry can collaboratively work is harmonising AI taxonomies and developing common benchmarks and metrics. Regulatory guardrails for new technologies 38. As AI adoption gains traction, regulatory oversight is crucial in ensuring an efficient, responsible and fair adoption. Recognising the increasing usage of model-driven credit assessments and decision-making in REs, the RBI had issued a draft circular on model risk management in credit 19 , setting out expectations on governance, validation, monitoring, and accountability. Building on this foundation and recognising the increasing usage of models by the REs, not only for credit functions but also for wide spectrum of processes across functional and operational domains, the Bank is in the process of expanding the scope of these guidelines and would be issuing overarching Model Risk Management Guidelines applicable across all models. As technologies like AI are generally not adopted uniformly across the sector and owing to presence of a varied type of entities with different scales, the principle of proportionality has to be also factored in. The objective would be to ensure that all REs can adopt technologies best suited to their business models and customer needs, while effectively managing risks such as explainability, algorithmic bias, resilience, and over-automation 20 . In continuation of this approach, the recently released report of the Committee on Framework for Responsible, Efficient, and Ethical AI (FREE-AI) 21 , has laid out seven guiding sutras for trustworthy AI, and emphasized the need for a robust model risk management framework by REs. Conclusion 39. Over the decades, Indian banking sector has exhibited its ability to integrate meaningful technological advancements. As AI transforms financial services, it's clear this is a development which is not a mere upgrade but a major shift impacting products, processes, and operations. From the risk perspective, the long-term implications of AI adoption on the financial system remain uncertain but exhibit potentially far-reaching consequences. It is therefore imperative for the financial sector to approach AI adoption with foresight, investing not just in innovation, but also in resilience by building strong governance structure, diversifying dependencies, engaging in continual assessment of emerging risks, and ensuring their AI strategies align with long-term safety and sustainability of the financial system. Ensuring that AI-driven decisions are ethical, unbiased, and transparent will be paramount in building a sustainable, AI-powered financial future. This calls for “ optimistic vigilance ” wherein AI and other technologies in banking are neither feared nor embraced blindly but “ navigated” . The RBI, on its part, will continue to provide an enabling regulatory environment so that together we can build a banking system that truly builds Bharat, and not just builds, but transforms Bharat. 40. Let me sign off with the thought “Trust is the currency of banking”. Even as we broaden the credit coverage using algorithms and digital interfaces, maintaining the trust will be our biggest challenge and also our biggest responsibility.

      "summary": "It gives me immense pleasure to participate in the FIBAC annual conference for this year. It brings together distinguished thought leaders and stakeholders of the Indian economy and our financial ecosystem to deliberate on critical and contemporary issues facing the economic landscape of our country. The topic of the Conference “Charting New Frontiers” is very relevant and topical as we respond to the new challenges of tariffs and geopolitical uncertainties. I am sure that the discussions in this conference will be very fruitful and provide deeper insights and guidance to all stakeholders, especially businesses, regulators and governments. This is all the more important as we strive to contribute in our journey for a Viksit Bharat by 2047. I compliment FICCI and IBA for organising this annual conference. I. India’s’ Story of Resilience and Stability 2. We celebrated our 79th Independence Day ten days ago. We have made huge progress since our independence. Our advancement spreads across sectors – education, health, agriculture, industries, infrastructure, science and technology, defence, governance, finance, etc. The Indian economy has expanded manifold. It continues to be a symbol of resilience and hope. The achievements of the Indian economy despite unprecedented challenges in the last few years are undoubtedly creditable and widely recognised. 3. The Indian economy today is characterised by robust macroeconomic fundamentals. Indian economy rebounded strongly post-COVID and recorded an average annual growth of around 8 per cent during the last four years (2021-22 to 2024-25), supported by strong domestic demand – both private consumption and fixed investment - amidst challenging global economic conditions. The IMF has projected that India will be the fastest growing major economy. We are all set to become the third-largest economy in the coming years. Inflation levels have generally reduced after implementation of the inflation targeting. Headline inflation recorded an eight year low of 1.6 per cent in July this year. 4. India’s fiscal situation too has seen significant improvement after the post-COVID counter-cyclical fiscal response with a focus on the quality of expenditure. The union government’s fiscal deficit to GDP ratio is budgeted to moderate from a high of 9.2 per cent to 4.4 per cent of GDP in 2025-26. Quality of expenditure has improved. Central government’s effective capital expenditure which includes capital grants-in-aid to the states is budgeted at 4.3 per cent of GDP for 2025-26. Corporate balance-sheets are healthy. Banks are well capitalised, with sufficient liquidity buffers, robust asset quality and reasonable profitability. My compliments to the industry, especially the banking sector for this impressive performance. 5. India’s external sector has also strengthened considerably over the last decade. The current account deficit (CAD) has remained well within the sustainable limit in recent years - it was 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2024-25. This is due to robust services exports and strong remittance receipts despite higher merchandise trade deficit. Capital flows have generally exceeded the CAD, adding to our foreign exchange reserves which stood at 695 billion USD as on August 15, 2025, providing merchandise imports cover of over 11 months. 6. Proactive fiscal and monetary policies, structural reforms, massive upscaling of both physical and digital infrastructure, improved governance and enhanced productivity and competitiveness, have all contributed to this impressive performance. 7. We are at a critical juncture as we navigate the choppy global economic environment characterised by heightened trade uncertainty and persisting geopolitical tensions. We need to push the frontiers of growth. We all must step up our efforts to address the emerging challenges and capitalise on the opportunities ahead. Generations of freedom fighters gave us a free India, a Swatantra Bharat. We need to now work for a Samridh Bharat, a prosperous India. In this backdrop, I thought it appropriate to speak on what we need to do together to further build on our economic development. I have divided this into five major areas - monetary policy, regulation, financial inclusion, customer service and technology. II. Monetary Policy 8. The role of monetary policy in economic prosperity is critical. One of the major conduits of macroeconomic stability in India during recent years despite multiple shocks, has been the decline of inflation. Sharp spikes in food prices, volatile oil prices, global supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions could have significantly stoked inflation. However, proactive policy measures by the Reserve Bank, including timely interest rate adjustments and liquidity management, alongside prudent supply side measures by the government, have helped contain generalisation of price pressures. Anchored inflation expectations too have supported stable consumption patterns and improved investor confidence. The primary objective of monetary policy in terms of price stability has significantly contributed to the strength of India's macroeconomic fundamentals. At the same time, the Reserve Bank has not lost sight of the objective of growth. For example, before covid, when growth was slowing, and in recent months, when inflation was benign and growth needed to be supported, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the policy repo rate. We will continue to conduct monetary policy with the primary objective of price stability keeping in view the objective of growth. III. Regulation of Banks and NBFCs Importance of regulation 9. Despite increase in other sources of credit, the banks, NBFCs, HFCs and AIFIs regulated by RBI still provide about 73 per cent of the credit needs of the real economy with banks providing about 53 per cent. This shows the continued importance of RBI regulated entities in meeting the credit needs of the economy. 10. It has been our endeavour to regulate these entities with an aim to ensure that the financial system remains healthy and grows sustainably. Here I would like to mention that regulations are akin to friction. If friction is too less, one will fall while walking and if it is too much, progress will be impeded. Regulations provide the necessary friction to promote financial stability and safety of depositors hard-earned money. However, stringent regulations may impede growth of the economy. The art of regulation-making lies in finding the right balance between safety and growth - “the right amount of friction”. Pursuit of this balance, or optimal regulation, is indeed our constant endeavour in the RBI. Our approach to regulation making 11. Our regulatory framework is based on five principles or characteristics: First, we have gradually pivoted from being prescriptive to largely principle based. Second, we have espoused the idea of proportionality to strike a fine balance between costs and benefits of regulation. Impact analysis is an integral component of this. Third, we are consultative in our approach. We realise that we need to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders. We organise outreach with industry, associations, banks, NBFCs and other regulated entities. We have also operationalised ‘connect to regulate’ for direct connection with our stakeholders. We seek your active support in giving feedback and suggestions for better regulation-making. Fourth, we attempt to be evidence based. We gather information through our interaction and outreach as also through our supervisory teams. Some of the REs may be feeling the burden of our information seek from them. But, information is important for regulation-making. We seek your assistance in this regard. Fifth, we are agile and we adapt with change in context, availability of new information, and the evolving landscape. We have not hesitated in relaxing a stringent rule, once deemed necessary, if the context changes and the cost-benefit balance reverses. 12. What we do as a matter of practice, has now been institutionalised through the recently released “Framework for Formulation of Regulations” which codifies this approach, that I just highlighted. Regulatory Developments in Recent Past 13. Entering into this calendar year, we have rationalised the applicable prudential norms for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) to accord flexibility in their operations; we restored the applicable risk weights for lending to NBFCs as risks abated. Similarly, the provisioning requirement for government guaranteed security receipts were reviewed in view of their sovereign nature. We have updated the priority sector lending (PSL) guidelines to boost credit to underserved segments. We rationalised run-off factors, which will potentially lead to a cumulative improvement in LCR of about 6 percentage points for the system as a whole. Similarly, we have come out with comprehensively rationalised regulatory framework for investments in Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), co-lending, non-fund-based facilities, project finance, and gold loans to name a few. These are examples of how we have been agile, consultative, evidence-oriented, principle-based, and proportional in our regulation-making. Proposed regulations 14. Going forward, we will continue this approach. Our focus will be three-fold. First and foremost, we will continue strengthening financial stability. We intend to implement Basel III guidelines for market, credit and operational risk from 1.4.2027, for which credit risk and ECL related draft guidelines are proposed to be issued soon. The Forms of Business circular is also planned to be finalised quickly. 15. Second, we will endeavour to enhance ease of doing business. We have already rationalised the returns that regulated entities have to submit to us. We are in the process of consolidating all the regulations for various categories of regulated entities. In our pursuit of making principle-based framework, we have given autonomy to the board of the respective entities to frame policies. While the intent was to leave detailed policy-making to the judgement of the bank, it has resulted in overburdening the boards of the regulated entities. Therefore, we are trying to rationalise the macro-policies that need to be approved by the Boards of the regulated entities, and leave the procedural and routine matters with the management so that the Board gets quality time to deliberate on strategic and important matters. 16. Third, we are examining measures to expand bank credit towards productive sectors and reduce cost of intermediation. 17. As announced earlier, we propose to set up a Regulatory Review Cell with the mandate to review each regulation in a comprehensive, objective, systematic and structured manner. The objective of the review shall be to assess each regulation with focus on efficiency; its impact in terms of cost and benefit; its requirement in the current context and market realities; consistency and clarity especially across different regulations; and potential of unaddressed or emerging risks, among other things. The Cell shall organise its work in such a manner that each regulation is reviewed at least once in every 5-7 years. The Cell will interact with major financial sector industry bodies. IV. Financial Inclusion 18. Economic development is incomplete if it is not inclusive. We believe in the adage “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together” . We need to take everyone together and especially those at the bottom of the pyramid. We have made considerable progress in financial inclusion over the years as reflected in the Financial Inclusion (FI)-Index constructed by the RBI which is based on the three dimensions of financial inclusion, ‘Access’, ‘Usage’ and ‘Quality’. Notwithstanding the considerable progress, FI-Index point towards scope for further improvement in usage and quality while also addressing gaps in access. 19. Let us remember we have a responsibility to all the people of our country, almost two-thirds, of which resides in rural areas. While, we have provided banking access to almost all villages within a radius of 5 kilometres, there is scope to further enhance it. Business Correspondents (BCs) are an effective channel for providing services in sparsely populated areas of our country. This channel needs to be strengthened to improve the quality, consistency and reach of financial services. Not only is there is a scope to augment them, but there is also a need to train them and expand the number of services they can provide. On one hand, this will make the BCs financially viable and sustainable; on the other hand, it will improve quality and reach of services. 20. Towards the objective of financial inclusion and to ensure uninterrupted access to the financial services, banks have launched a country-wide campaign from July 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025 at Gram Panchayat level. I urge all the banks to step up their efforts through these camps towards enhancing the coverage of re-KYC and the social security schemes. I also seek your support to Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs) and Centres for Financial Literacy (CFLs), being operated under our aegis. 21. Another area of focus is the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector which contributes significantly to employment, exports and output. There is a significant credit gap to MSMEs. Banks and NBFCs should make special efforts to boost formal credit to them. They should leverage the public digital infrastructure like the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), in this endeavour. V. Customer Service 22. Consumers are the raison detre or the purpose of our being. Customer-centricity is fundamental for sustainable growth of any business. Conduct related regulations 23. At the Reserve Bank, we are passionately driven by the objective of customer-centricity. Key Fact Statement and integrating explicit conduct related aspects in our regulations are some examples in this regard. Recently released revised guidelines on pre-payment charges and draft guidelines on settlement of claims in respect of deceased customers also reflect our customer-first approach. Consumer service by REs 24. Similarly, regulated entities must focus on excellent and seamless service and experience, creating customer delight. They need to be transparent, fair, and responsive. While digitalization is a key, the human aspect too cannot be neglected, for which training, especially on behavioural aspects, needs to be emphasized. 25. I had on an earlier occasion urged the Banks to enable the use of CKYCR at KYC touch points. I had also highlighted that the number of grievances escalating to the RBI Ombudsman is very high. It was also expected that each RE has an effective grievance redressal mechanism, where officers are suitably empowered to take decisions in consumer interest. I exhort the regulated entities to make further improvements in these areas. 26. Further, we are in the process of reviewing the Internal Ombudsman framework at the level of REs to further strengthen it and ensure that complaints get resolved effectively within the institution itself. We are also reviewing the RB-IOS to enhance its effectiveness, transparency and customer-centricity as an alternate grievance redressal mechanism. Further, we intend to enhance the consistency and adequacy of compensation awarded under the Ombudsman framework. We also plan to expand the set of services, non-timely provision of which may be liable for payment of penalty. 27. Consumer’s trust is vital not only for the regulated entity but also for the stability and resilience of the banking system. To build and maintain trust, it is essential that regulated entities (REs) put in place a robust and effective mechanism to redress the grievances of aggrieved customers proactively in a just, transparent, timely and affordable manner. They should periodically assess the types of complaints, conduct a root cause analysis and implement systemic corrective measures in product design, processes, and employee conduct. It is further suggested that customer satisfaction related KPIs are included in performance appraisal and variable pay of key functionaries. VI. Technology to enhance credit and efficiency 28. Use of technology is a sine quo non for any business. It has become the core engine for improving decision making and customer service, moving far beyond its traditional role of driving efficiency. Regulated entities need to accelerate its adoption as they strive to enhance credit and reduce costs. 29. RBI too has adopted technology in all its functions. The Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem is empowering customers with control over their financial data. ULI is making credit delivery seamless, making it truly transformative. We will further strengthen these platforms. We have implemented PRAVAAH platform for improving services to regulated entities. We will continue to embrace technology including AI and ML and expect our regulated entities too invest in it. VII. Concluding remarks 30. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that while we might seem to be on opposite sides – with the regulated entities trying to accelerate growth and the regulators focusing on stability, we actually have the same objectives. We are in the same team with a shared vision of a Viksit Bharat . There is no tussle between financial stability and growth. Financial stability and price stability do not inhibit growth. Far from it, they are essential for sustainable growth. 31. I look forward to working together with the regulated entities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of financial intermediation to ensure that the due benefits reach the people of our nation. Likewise, on the demand side, I urge the industry to invest boldly and champion the entrepreneurial spirit that defines our nation. At a time, when balance sheet of banks and corporates are at their best, they should come together and drive the animal spirits to create an investment cycle which is so important at this juncture. 32. Lastly, in your respective roles, I urge you not to ever lose sight of the people you are serving. At the cost of sounding a bit sermonic, I must say that if there is any doubt in your mind, espouse the philosophies of Gandhi’s Talisman , or Antyodaya . Take decisions keeping in mind how your actions will impact the most vulnerable person of our country. 33. I wish the conference a huge success. Thank you. Namaskar. Jai Hind.",

      "summary": "Participants of the ‘Management Development Programme on Financial Market Regulations’, Professors, ladies, and gentlemen. A very good morning to all of you! 2. At the outset, I would like to thank IIM, Kozhikode for inviting me here. It is a pleasure to address such a diverse gathering, ranging from policy veterans to important stakeholders across the financial landscape. The contents of programme span the issues around the regulatory framework of a diverse mix of entities operating in the financial markets including banks, securities firms, and insurance entities. 3. Financial markets span a wide array of products starting with money markets, G Secs, forex, equities, commodities, and derivatives. These products are traded bilaterally, over the counter, or increasingly on electronic trading platforms or on exchanges. The entities are diverse, and they are active in many of these markets. They are regulated by different regulators depending on the nature of entities and/or their activities. The markets are interconnected with spillover risks from one set of market activities into another, increasingly becoming a point of concern from the point of view of financial stability. In my remarks today, I would like to, therefore, share a few perspectives on the need for market and entity regulations and their interplay, the tools employed by the regulators and the challenges faced in framing regulations for a rapidly evolving and interlinked financial ecosystem; and conclude by sharing a few thoughts on the way forward. The role and evolution of financial sector regulations in India 4. To set the stage, it is essential to start by tracing the evolution of financial sector regulations in India, which commenced with the establishment of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 1935. The Bank’s remit was expanded in 1949 to cover regulation and supervision of commercial banks 2 . This was succeeded by empowering it to regulate and supervise non-banking institutions 3 now commonly referred to as Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in 1964 4 and thereafter Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in 1966 5 . 5. The year 1991 is extremely significant as it ushered in key economic reforms which helped to transform and grow our economy. The reforms in the financial sector started in a way, with the implementation of the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee on financial sector reforms. The entry of private banks, introduction of prudential norms for banks, and alignment of capital adequacy requirements with global standards based on the recommendations of the Committee and conferring of statutory powers to the Reserve Bank to exercise greater oversight over the NBFCs were important policy landmarks during this period. This together with the subsequent changes in the monetary policy framework 6 , the liberalisation of the exchange control regime and the grant of powers to regulate the Payment and Settlement Systems as well as the money, foreign exchange, and government securities (G-Sec) markets to the Reserve Bank, have collectively influenced the changes in the approach to regulation making at the Reserve Bank. 6. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was statutorily entrusted with regulation and development of the securities market in the year 1992 7 . The subsequent decades saw establishment of new financial sector regulators in the form of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to oversee the regulation of the insurance and reinsurance sectors and of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) for pension funds. More recently in 2020, the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) was created to regulate and promote financial products, services, and institutions within India’s International Financial Services Centres. Collectively, these regulators play a critical role in the journey of transforming India’s financial system into a more resilient, market-driven, and consumer-centric ecosystem, while facilitating sustainable economic growth of the country. Approach for Regulation making 7. The market-oriented laissez-faire approach towards Regulation of financial markets with minimal regulations operates on the assumption that self-regulation will be effective. However, this view has been contested by some economists and policymakers who argue that regulation is not just necessary but essential. They contend that the idea of inherently self-correcting markets is more of an ideological fad than a factual occurrence, and that effective oversight is crucial to ensure stability, transparency, and protection of the financial sector against systemic risks. Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz in his influential book Freefall: Free Markets and the Sinking of the Global Economy writes, “The crisis has made it clear that self-regulation – which the financial industry promoted and which I view as an oxymoron – doesn’t work.” Time and again it has been proven that financial regulation is essential not only to prevent market failures, but also to protect consumers and safeguard the stability and resilience of the broader economy, particularly in times of crisis. The common misconception that regulation inherently imposes restrictive barriers, is inaccurate. A well-designed financial oversight framework underpinned by thoughtfully crafted regulations not only ensures a level playing field but also fosters sustainable growth and development. How do we regulate financial systems 8 8. Before delving into the specific approaches to regulation-making, it is important to first reflect on the broader frameworks for financial system regulation, especially considering that alternative models of financial oversight are in vogue. 9. The regulatory oversight architecture for financial systems can be broadly categorised into three main models . The first model is known as ‘sectoral or traditional model’ , in which each of the financial sector authorities is responsible for both - prudential and conduct aspects of the specific financial sector, i.e., banking, insurance, securities and market integrity. This approach has been followed by countries like India, Brazil, Hong Kong and Mexico and remains the most commonly used model around the world. However, challenges arise in such a model while dealing with financial conglomerates, whose activities blur the boundaries between different types of financial institutions. Such trade-offs can be smoothed by introducing complementary arrangements, like those adopted by Indian Financial Sector Regulators (FSRs), which I will discuss later. 10. An alternative approach is the ‘integrated model’ , where a single agency oversees all oversight functions including regulations across the finance industry. This model was adopted by Singapore in 1984 as a consequence of reforms in financial oversight architecture. Later Scandinavian countries adopted similar models, followed by the UK, which established a single Financial Services Authority (FSA) in 1997. Further, countries like Russia, Japan, Germany and South Korea have adopted this model in their financial architecture. While this approach offers a cohesive and streamlined framework for overseeing the financial sector, enabling unified decision-making, reduced regulatory arbitrage, and improved co-ordination, it may present some operational challenges like risk of possible single point of regulatory failure, dilution of sectoral focus and reduced flexibility in addressing the needs of different sub-sectors. 11. The third model involves grouping responsibilities either according to regulatory and supervisory goals or according to sectors, i.e., partially integrated approach . The ‘Twin Peaks’ model is an example of this, where two separate agencies manage each of the prudential oversight and conduct of business for all types of financial institutions. This model was first adopted in Australia in 1997, followed by Netherlands in 2002 and thereafter introduced in Canada and South Africa. After the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the UK restructured its regulatory framework by replacing the integrated model with Twin Peaks model by bifurcating FSA in two institutions - the Financial Conduct Authority which focuses on market conduct, and the Prudential Regulation Authority (under the aegis of Central Bank) responsible for the prudential regulation and supervision of banks, building societies, credit unions, insurers and major investment firms. The Twin Peaks model leverages potential synergies arising in the prudential or the business conduct oversight of various types of financial institutions but faces similar challenges of lack of sectoral focus as in the integrated model and co-ordination challenges as in sectoral model. 12. The Two Agency model is another example of the partially integrated model where one agency is responsible for the regulation and supervision of both solvency and conduct of business for banks and insurance companies, and a second agency is responsible for market integrity and the securities business. It is currently in place in jurisdictions such as France, Italy, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, etc. 13. The models in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) have special characteristics. While in the US functions have been assigned to various agencies at the federal and state level, in the EU, countries within the euro zone share a single prudential supervisory authority for significant banks. More recently, after the GFC, the macroprudential policy and resolution functions were the areas which were added to the financial oversight architecture, which may or may not involve separate agencies depending on the type of model adopted. 14. Each model includes trade-offs between synergies and potential conflicts of interest and challenges. The decision to adopt a financial oversight model depends on the structure and evolution of the financial sector, legal, cultural, and political economy considerations as well as past experiences like dealing with financial crises. Whichever be the model, one of the key features of any financial oversight architecture is the Central Bank remains the primary or lead authority. Its leadership in coordinating with other regulatory entities reinforces the coherence, resilience, and credibility of the overall financial oversight architecture. 15. Let me now touch upon the approaches adopted by regulators for the regulation-making process. While there may be differing views on the most apt approach to regulations, there is no ‘one size fit all’ approach. Regulators use different approaches and tools to address varied types of problems for effective regulation. Principle vs. Rule vs. Outcome based regulation 16. Principle based regulation is qualitative and uses high-level statements with an explanation of the underlying intent. It gives flexibility and freedom to a Regulated Entity (RE) to innovate by developing new products and services without being constrained by prescriptive rules. However, it is open to subjective interpretation and can therefore pose challenges for both REs and supervisors, thus limiting enforcement and accountability. It may also be less effective in areas like consumer protection, where clear and actionable directions are essential. In the context of Reserve Bank as a banking regulator, the Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets 9 is an example of principle-based regulation. 17. Rule-based regulation, on the other hand, requires an RE to comply with specific, prescriptive requirements. It leads to better clarity, compliance, and consistency, as it simplifies the understanding of regulations for an RE and consumer alike. However, it may lead to a ‘check-the-box’ mentality, resulting in compliance by REs in letter but not in spirit. The REs may also face challenges when dealing with complex and dynamic issues where nuanced judgment is required. The Master Directions on Priority Sector Lending – Targets and Classification 10 can be considered as an example of a rule-based regulation issued by the Bank. 18. Another approach which has gained prominence of late is the outcome-based regulation, with focus on desired outcomes or results rather than prescribing specific processes and tools. This approach sets \"what\" is the desired outcome, while providing flexibility on \"how\" to achieve it. The RBI’s Directions on Digital Lending 11 emphasise on the desired outcome, i.e., transparency and fairness for borrowers, rather than getting into specifics like lending rates or methods. 19. Striking the right balance amongst these approaches is critical to creating an enabling, and effective regulatory environment while encouraging innovation, given the complexities of today’s dynamic financial landscape. Activity vs. Entity based regulation 20. Activity-based regulation prescribes regulatory obligations for specific activities, independent of the entity undertaking them. It works on the principle of “same activity, same risk, same rules”. The Directions issued on Financial Services provided by Banks 12 can be categorised as activity-based regulation. 21. In contrast, entity-based regulation aims to bolster the resilience of activities with focus on the entity. This approach encompasses governance, prudential and conduct requirements, reinforced by supervisory interventions. Given that an entity’s overall resilience is shaped by the composition of its activities, entity-based regulations place targeted restrictions – an essential feature of such regulation. The prudential norms on capital adequacy are in nature of entity-based regulation. 22. Given the distinct regulatory domains, and keeping in view the objective of financial stability, regulators often adopt a hybrid approach that integrates elements of both activity-based and entity-based regulation. Such a tailored regulatory framework enhances the comprehensiveness and resilience of oversight mechanisms. It allows regulators to respond more effectively to market developments and emerging risks, thereby strengthening the overall regulatory architecture and promoting a sound, stable, and inclusive financial system. 13 Rules based vs. Risk based approach 14 23. Rules-based regulation focusses on adherence to regulatory prescriptions regardless of the level of risk. Though beneficial at times, the approach should factor in principle of proportionality, as not all entities carry same amount of risk to financial stability or consumer protection. 24. Adopting a risk-based approach enables regulators to frame regulations that are both effective and proportionate in the dynamic financial environment of today. This also helps in directing scarce regulatory and supervisory resources in optimal manner while also fostering innovation and financial inclusion. The Scale Based Regulation issued by RBI for Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) 15 and revised regulatory framework for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) 16 , can be thought of as recent examples of a risk-based approach. Market vs. entity regulation 25. Market-based regulation focuses on the overall structure and functioning of financial markets, while entity-based regulation deals with the prudential norms, conduct, solvency, and internal risk management of individual financial institutions. Although each Financial Sector Regulator (FSR) such as the RBI, SEBI, IRDAI, PFRDA, or IFSCA has its distinct regulatory domain, activities of many of their REs overlap. Depending on their activities, these entities may fall under multiple regulatory frameworks, resulting in differential oversight and heightened operational complexity. For example, a mutual fund or an insurance company participating in government securities market or a bank participating in corporate bond market. To address such overlaps, FSRs are increasingly adopting a co-ordinated approach to regulation and supervision, with the broader goal of ensuring financial stability. Challenges in regulation making 26. Regulation making is a complex process starting from identification of risks or gaps in existing regulations, evaluation of options to address them and finally coming out with an appropriate and effective regulation which is intended to address the risks for the entity and for the financial system (prudence, resilience and stability) and/or empower the consumers and ensure fair conduct amongst entities (conduct issues). While treading this path, the regulators are often confronted with many challenges. Let me highlight a few of them. Balancing innovation and stability 17 27. Innovation in the financial sector has brought about transformative changes. However, the rapid pace of innovation, also leads to regulatory gaps or grey areas. Innovations often take shape of new business models and partnerships with third parties, who are outside the regulatory ambit of the FSRs. It is the job of the regulator to plug these loopholes by framing rules in such a manner that allows innovation to thrive but provide sufficient guardrails to ensure that financial system remains stable and resilient. The regulators are therefore adopting a more agile and forward-looking approach - like the development of regulatory sandboxes and enhancing dialogue with key stakeholders for integrating the new players into the regulatory framework, while being mindful of financial stability. Keeping pace with emerging risks and technologies 28. The regulators need to keep pace with dynamically changing markets and deal with emerging risks and technologies. This requires regulators to devise approaches to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and also ensuring the safety of the financial system, while providing space for innovation. I would like to highlight two examples of the challenges faced by the regulators. (I) Climate risk 29. Addressing climate change not only requires transition towards sustainability, but also integration of climate related financial risks into regulatory framework. Regulators across the world are debating whether climate risk warrants a separate framework or should it be embedded within existing risk categories. There is also ongoing discussion on whether climate risk oversight should form part of Pillar 2 (supervisory review), or Pillar 1 (capital and liquidity requirements). This continues to engage the attention of the standard setting bodies, industry and other stakeholders and there is a need to strike right balance to harmonize environmental stewardship with maintenance of financial stability. 18 (II) Emerging technologies 30. New technologies improve ease of doing business, reduce operational and compliance costs, but they also pose challenges for regulation. There are three primary challenges in regulating these technologies: (i) the unpredictable nature of business models that rely on emerging technologies, (ii) data privacy, security, ownership, and control, and (iii) the artificial intelligence (AI) conundrum. 19 One example of new business models is Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) model which increases scale and speed of distribution of financial products but could also lead to significant business conduct risks. Regulators face a dilemma: whether to come out with a framework before such financial innovations happen or allow markets to develop, risking unanticipated systemic risks and exploitative consumer practices. 20 Additionally, regulators must navigate capacity constraints and legal complexities in crafting effective regulations. 31. Here too, we have adopted a cautious approach while coming out with regulations like digital lending directions covering partnerships between FinTechs (as Lending Service Providers) and REs, introduction of Video based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP) etc., in these emerging technology areas. The RBI had constituted a committee to develop a robust, comprehensive, and adaptable Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of Artificial Intelligence (FREE-AI) for the Financial Sector 21 which has come out with a principle-based approach to AI adoption in the financial sector. Reducing regulatory burden and ensuring compliance 32. India has made notable progress in improving its business environment over the years, however, there is still ample scope for further improvement. Regulatory burden and compliance costs pose challenges to REs, more so for smaller REs. Regulators not only need to do a delicate balancing act of reducing the burden and compliance cost for the REs but also need to ensure that it does not hinder the efficient functioning of markets. The Reserve Bank has pioneered some initiatives over time, which I would like to highlight: To reduce compliance burden, RBI had constituted a Regulatory Review Authority (RRA) in 1999, followed by establishment of the second RRA (RRA 2.0) in 2021. The RRA 2.0 led to withdrawal or repeal of a total of 1,673 circulars, and discontinuation/ online conversion/ merger of 78 returns. The ‘Connect 2 Regulate’ Platform has been introduced on RBI’s website to broaden involvement of members of the public and stakeholders in policy formulation and review, thereby making the process more consultative. The ‘PRAVAAH’ (Platform for Regulatory Application, VAlidation and AutHorisation), a secure and centralised web-based portal for any individual or entity to seek authorisation, license or regulatory approval on any reference made to the Reserve Bank has been launched to enhance the efficiency of processes related to granting of regulatory approvals. To formalise participatory and responsive regulation making and demonstrating RBI’s commitment to enhanced transparency and consultative approach a comprehensive Framework for the Formulation of Regulations was issued on May 7, 2025 22 . It lays down broad principles for drafting, amending, and reviewing regulations by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank is in the process of setting up a Regulatory Review Cell that would review all regulations every five to seven years. Data, capacity and resource constraints 33. Another area which continues to engage the attention of the regulators is the lack of precise data to effectively formulate new policies. Rapid evolution of financial technologies has led to an exponential increase in the volume of data generated, however, challenges remain with respect to comprehensiveness, credibility, and accuracy of such information. Though regulators are equipping themselves with the latest tools and skills, the pace at which requirements are evolving is breath-taking. This requires continued capacity building within the regulators. Inter-Regulatory co-ordination 34. As alluded to earlier, the Indian financial sector is characterised by significant heterogeneity, comprising of varied players governed by multiple FSRs, each responsible for entities operating under its purview. This demands robust and effective inter-regulatory co-ordination to facilitate consistent policy making. To address this challenge, an integrated approach to oversight has been adopted by the Financial Sector Regulators (FSRs) for financial conglomerates operating across multiple sectors, based on the ‘lead regulator’ principle. Joint supervision and periodic bilateral/multilateral discussions with such financial conglomerates are some of the tools adopted as a part of this approach. 35. The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) headed by the Finance Minister and its Sub-Committee, headed by RBI Governor, where all heads of FSRs are represented, provides a platform for combined assessment of risks from the financial stability perspective and plays a pivotal role, for inter-regulatory co-ordination on the matters where there is overlap among FSRs. Such platforms help in further strengthening inter-regulatory co-ordination for wider development of financial sector in India. 36. However, there could be certain areas, such as increasing partnerships between the technological firms and the REs, where activities may fall outside the remit of any of the FSRs, exposing the REs to risks arising out of these activities. Addressing such risks, many a times becomes challenging for regulators and requires effective co-ordination among international regulators/ supervisors so that they do not lead to a systemic crisis. This remains a complex area for regulators, given the concerns around privacy, confidentiality, and enforcement. Way forward Principle and outcome-based approach 37. There is no perfect regulatory approach, however, principle and outcome-based regulation is generally found to be more suitable for mature markets. Nevertheless, even developed economies use rule-based framework when it comes to safeguarding interests of consumers. We, at the Reserve Bank are gradually shifting towards principle and outcome-based regulations, as it gives operational flexibility to the REs for conduct of their operations and tailor their activities to their unique needs, while adhering to the regulatory framework for delivering the outcomes expected from them. Forward looking and proactive approach 38. Regulators are often confronted with complex challenges while framing regulations, necessitating adoption of a forward-looking approach. Addressing emerging risks calls for nuanced and adaptive strategies to ensure resilience. Regulators must adopt a more proactive mindset to help build a financial system that is both resilient and adaptable. Being proactive entails embracing innovation and fully leveraging data and technology. They need to further leverage technology to enhance their efficiency - both internal and supervisory, carry out regulatory horizon risk scanning and boost regulatory effectiveness. Usage of rapidly evolving technologies and collaboration with domain experts is need of the hour for the regulators to stay abreast of the evolving changes in the financial system. Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) 39. Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA) are increasingly being recognised as essential tools for policy makers, enabling the development of policies that are grounded in evidence, clear in their purpose, proportionate in design, and responsive to real world conditions. These tools can be useful to strike a balance, by guarding against both unnecessary compliance burden and regulatory gaps, while boosting public confidence and enhancing international standing. Two essential elements of RIA are (i) Cost Benefit Analysis of the regulations, which can be evaluated either through qualitative or quantitative parameters or through a mix of both and (ii) consultation with a broad spectrum of stakeholders. While the latter leads to enhanced transparency, fostering trust, and improvement in the quality and effectiveness of the regulations, the former helps determine the optimal solution for addressing the problem while ensuring efficient allocation of resources. 40. Another important area is timely review of regulatory prescriptions and reporting mechanisms with a view to streamlining/ rationalising them and making them more effective. Such timely reviews not only reduce compliance requirements but also offer the regulators an opportunity to review the appropriateness of regulations in line with evolving market practices and developments. Regulators should endeavour to adopt best practices in their regulatory approaches, both ex-ante, to assess potential impact and avoid unintended consequences and ex-post, to assess actual impact and support course correction while enhancing future rule design, so that together, they ensure that regulation is both “right the first time” and “kept right over time”. Enhancing compliance 41. The regulators should have a broader vision of enhancing compliance by REs to make it easier for them to comply with regulations. This can be done by simplifying regulations, enhancing their clarity and removing redundancies and duplications. The Reserve Bank has been emphasising on clarity in regulations and has started including examples, FAQs and illustrations as a part of its regulations for the benefit of the REs. To provide a high-level overview of the regulatory landscape and serve as a broad point of reference for general understanding of the REs, the Reserve Bank had come out with a Handbook titled ‘Regulations at a Glance’ 23 . Further, the Reserve Bank is in the process of consolidating more than 8,000 regulations issued by Department of Regulation, under 30-35 thematic subjects. The regulators need to persist with such initiatives for enhancing the responsiveness of the REs and development of the financial sector. International and domestic regulatory co-operation 42. Given the cross sectoral operations of entities, there is a need for the FSRs to move away from siloed, sector-specific regulations towards cross-functional principle-based regulations. This co-ordination will foster innovation and enable the REs to offer services across different domains as also ensure that they have appropriate risk management protocols. This would also help in capping regulatory arbitrage, while simultaneously reducing compliance requirements for the REs. Additionally, co-operation among regulators across jurisdictions is essential for sharing insights, expertise, and resources to enable more efficient regulation without compromising on quality. 24 International standards serve as a valuable reference point; however, they must be adapted to local contexts and conditions, as a 'one size fits all' approach is neither practical nor effective in today’s diverse regulatory landscape. Consumer centricity 43. We need to consider the impact that regulations can have on one of the most important stakeholders in financial system i.e., consumers. Regulators have remained conscious of the need to empower consumers and safeguard their interests. To advance this objective, they must think beyond conventional approaches. Behavioral economics offers a powerful tool in this regard, providing valuable insights into consumer behavior and decision-making processes. It equips the regulators with an advanced set of policy instruments, most notably, behavioral nudges 25 , which can complement conventional regulatory frameworks by achieving the desired outcomes at far lower compliance costs, thus presenting a more efficient and socially beneficial policy alternative. 26 Conclusion 44. Regulatory policy in the financial sector must strike an optimal balance between the critical need for stability and objectives of fostering innovation, efficiency, and competition. While it is necessary to minimise systemic risks and protect consumers, it should not discourage creativity, innovation, or healthy market dynamics. On the other hand, an overemphasis on innovation and competition - without adequate safeguards - can lead to financial instability, resource misallocation, and ultimately loss of confidence in the system. Finding this right balance is particularly important for India, given the immense size and heterogeneity of economy, growing aspirations, and substantial investment needs to sustain high growth and development. The regulators must consistently strive to achieve this equilibrium. As Mahatma Gandhi said, “You may never know what results come of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no result.” Thank you once again for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you. I wish all participants an enriching and successful deliberations in the programme. 1 Inaugural Address delivered by Shri M Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India – August 18, 2025 - at the DoPT MDP on Financial Market Regulations at the Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode (IIMK).

Further, Myanmar was added to the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action in the October 2022 FATF plenary and FATF has called on its members and other jurisdictions to apply enhanced due diligence measures proportionate to the risk arising from Myanmar. When applying enhanced due diligence measures, countries have been advised to ensure that flows of funds for humanitarian assistance, legitimate NPO activity and remittances are not disrupted. The status of Myanmar in the list of countries subject to a call for action, remains unchanged. FATF had earlier identified the following jurisdictions as having strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing and had placed the jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring, which had developed action plan with the FATF to deal with them. These jurisdictions were: Algeria, Angola, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Lebanon, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Vietnam, Virgin Islands (UK) and Yemen. As per the October 24, 2025 FATF public statement Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa have been removed from this list based on review by the FATF. FATF plenary releases documents titled “High-Risk jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action” and “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring” with respect to jurisdictions that have strategic AML/CFT deficiencies as part of the ongoing efforts to identify and work with jurisdictions with strategic Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT) deficiencies. This advice does not preclude the regulated entities from legitimate trade and business transactions with these countries and jurisdictions mentioned there. The detailed information is available in the updated public statements and document released by FATF on October 24, 2025.

      "summary": "Today, the Reserve Bank released the data 1 related to the 2024-25 round of its annual survey on computer software and information technology enabled services (ITES) exports. The survey 2 collects details on India’s exports of software services {computer services and ITES/business process outsourcing (BPO) services} as per type of activity, on-site/off-site nature of services, country of destination and modes of supply. For 2024-25 round of the survey, 6,766 software export companies were contacted, of which 2,206 companies, including most of the large companies, responded. The participating companies together accounted around 90 per cent of total software services exports 3 ( Table 1 ). Highlights: Exports of software services by the Indian companies (excluding their sales through overseas commercial presence) are estimated to have increased by 7.3 per cent during 2024-25 to US$ 204.7 billion ( Table 2 ). Computer services continued to account for over two-thirds of India’s total software services exports during the year; BPO services remained the major component of ITES exports ( Tables 2 and 3 ). While private limited companies recorded a growth of 11.6 per cent in the total export of software services during the year, exports by public limited companies increased marginally by 1.3 per cent ( Table 4 ). Software exports to the United States of America (USA) increased at a lower pace of 4.9 per cent compared to 14.3 per cent growth for Europe. As a result, the share of USA in total software exports declined from 54.1 per cent during 2023-24 to 52.9 per cent during 2024-25. On the contrary, the share of Europe increased from 30.8 per cent to 32.8 per cent ( Table 5 ). The US Dollar was the principal invoicing currency constituting 72.0 per cent of India’s software exports, followed by the Euro (9.6 per cent), the INR (7.1 per cent) and the Pound Sterling (6.0 per cent) ( Table 6 ). The share of off-site mode in total exports of software services was 90.7 per cent in 2024-25 ( Table 7 ). Total software export services, including services delivered by foreign affiliates of Indian companies, increased by 6.5 per cent during 2024-25 and stood at US$ 218.6 billion Contribution of cross-border supply mode in total export of software services increased from 83.5 per cent in 2023-24 to 84.8 per cent during 2024-25, however share of other modes had declined ( Table 8 ).
